  <h2 class='c008'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>My</span> husband, although he completed the composition
of this work in his lifetime, passed away before
he had fully revised and prepared it for the press,
and the privilege of finally revising and editing it
has, consequently, devolved upon me. This, from
the nature of the subject, has been a task of some
difficulty, but I have spared no pains to accomplish
it to the best of my ability.</p>
<p class='c010'>As regards the orthography of Greek proper
names, I have thought it right to adhere, in most
cases, to the views of my husband, who was strongly
of opinion that the original spelling of the words in
Greek should, so far as practicable, be followed and
reproduced when they were expressed in English
characters.</p>

<p class='c010'>I should also mention that his reasons for using
the name of ‘the Great Athenian War’ to describe
the long contest usually known as ‘the Peloponnesian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>War’ are given at the beginning of
Chapter XXIX. at page <a href='#Page_415'>415</a> of the book.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a source of great delight to my husband
to compose this story of the life and times of
Alkibiades, and it is hoped that many of its readers
will feel, at any rate in some degree, a like pleasure
from perusing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will remind many who loved him of that
brilliant talk, that refined sensitiveness, that freshness
of wit and humour which went to make up his
unusual personality.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>In</span> the early morning of a spring day in Greece,
under a heaven of such a blue as one can seldom
see elsewhere, leaning from a window of one
of the noblest houses in Athens, looking sometimes
down on the town that lay beneath—awaking
to its daily life of work and thought
and happiness—or gazing up at the pure sky,
with the just finished Parthenon standing out
against it, imagine a boy of more than even
Grecian beauty. His light and slightly curling
hair was blown back from a lofty forehead,
his clear-cut, perfect features, and the healthy
hue upon his cheeks, resembling the pure white
marble of the temple and the glow of the
resplendent morning.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>He was only a boy, but in his gaze was something
more than ordinary childish wonder. An
earnest, wistful look, unsatisfied, told of a soul
which already sought to penetrate the things to
be, the mystery of the life that lay struggling in
the city at his feet—a longing for wings with
which to rise beyond the arching canopy above
him, if he could not find an answer here.</p>

<p class='c010'>His earliest recollection was of a high-born
gentleman, a nobler man than any he met now,
a stalwart warrior, his father Kleinias. He could
just remember how that father used to tell him
they traced their long descent up through a line
of heroes—through Ajax, son of Telamon, who
went with twelve great ships to the Siege of Troy,
and was the strongest, biggest of all the leaders
there. How Telamon was son of Aiakos, judge
of those dark regions somewhere underground,
in which the simple-minded soldier still believed;
and Aiakos, as all men knew, was son of Zeus
himself. Divine Achilles also, Peleus’s son, was
of his blood, for Peleus too was son of Aiakos.</p>

<p class='c010'>One day his father, dressed in the heavy
armour of the Grecian soldier, had come to him,
and having prayed the gods, with more than
even his usual deep reverence, to watch over
and protect his son, and make him worthy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>their race, had left him sorrowfully, and the
child heard soon afterwards an unwonted stir
in the great courtyard, and then the sound as
of tramping soldiers in the street, and the women
took him to the window, and he saw his father
marching at the head of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Kleinias, honoured of all men, went to fight
for Athens, and his son saw him again no more.
He died by his general’s side at Koroneia, and
oftentimes in after-years the fervent words of
his last prayer came vividly before the mind of
Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mother Deinomaché at first took charge
of him. She loved to tell him of the great men
through whom she was descended; how Amphiaraos,
who went with Jason on board the <i>Argo</i>
to seek the fleece of gold, was her ancestor; of
his son Alkmeon, who was married to the lovely
nymph; and of the great ruler Megakles and his
grandson, who, years ago, was crowned conqueror
at the Pythian games.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then of that Kleisthenes who raised the great
temple at Delphi from its ruins, turned out the
tyrant race of the Peisistratidai, and made Athens
free for ever. How Megakles’ brother, Hippokrates,
had two children: one of them, also
called Megakles, was her father; the other, wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of the general Xanthippos, who beat the
Persians at Mykale, was mother of the splendid
Perikles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perikles was by the will of Kleinias appointed
tutor to his son. So Alkibiades, when he was
thirteen, was taken by his paidagogos, Zopyros,
from his mother’s house to live in the bustle
and excitement of the great establishment of
Perikles.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brave Deinomaché tried hard to shed no
tear as her son went off. ‘Better,’ she said,
‘for you, my child, to learn to lead the people,
or to be a soldier like your father, with such
a one as my kinsman Perikles, than to waste
your boyhood here amongst old women.’ And
indeed it did seem time some stronger will than
his fond mother’s should rule the ardent, sometimes
overbearing, boy. If he was gentle to her
at home, he was impatient at the stupidity of
other boys and of the guidance of his feeble
paidagogos, and apt to show a proud contempt
for those he held to be the meaner sort.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet he felt somewhat shy and sad at first
when he found himself alone in the great house
of Perikles. His father’s house was large and
strong, and somewhat gloomy, but it was his
home. The days and nights were quiet there.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Besides his mother’s female friends, and the slave
women, and Zopyros, he had seen little of the
world. One day had passed in the big empty
house much in the same way as the day before
it, and as he supposed the next would do. Here,
in the home of the chief man in Athens—here was
a change indeed. Hurry and bustle all day long.
Busy politicians coming at all hours with their
cumbrous suggestions. Troops of poor petitioners
in want of something, and the important
Generals and Ministers of State, followed by their
slaves, as at the appointed time they came to
take counsel with the chief on the affairs of
Athens. Hurry and scurry all day long, scarce
a moment to himself, except on holidays, could
the great man get.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when the busy day was done, and the boy
was taken by Zopyros to the chambers set apart
for him, he heard the sound of the long revelry
deep into the night, the echo of the songs, the
murmur of the merry arguments, the coming and
going of the well-dressed slaves as they bore the
costly viands, the garnished dishes, the golden
vases of the old Greek wine, to the table of their
lord. And when the sound of revelry, which often
roused him from his sleep, was done, and the
lights in his part of the court were all gone out,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the boy saw others twinkling in that other part
where Aspasia lived with all her women.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aspasia! He had heard that name muttered
in his mother’s house in such a way he thought
it must be something bad—a name his mother’s
women hardly dared to speak aloud. But here
Aspasia, he found, when she deigned to grace
the board of Perikles, was treated as a queen.
A queen to him, indeed, she seemed to be—so
fair, so tender, so generous; and as she looked
with kind affection on the growing boy, son of
the worthy Kleinias, who had left him the orphan
pupil of her friend, he fell in love with her at
once, and thought he had never seen so beautiful
a lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What dost thou gaze at now, oh son of
Kleinias?’ a strong voice said, as a firm hand
was placed upon his shoulder, ‘and what art
thou thinking of this bright holiday? Shall not
thy paidagogos take thee to the palaistra, or wilt
thou rather stay and talk with me a while? It
is seldom I can see thee, child, or hear how thy
books agree with thee.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I was thinking, Perikles, of all the men and
women there below. Art thou indeed their
governor, and canst thou do whate’er thou wilt
with them?’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>‘Not I, forsooth, my boy; all citizens are
free and equal by the laws of Athens.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Dost thou not make their laws?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No; not so, indeed. They make their laws
themselves. I do but counsel them, and, as long
as they permit, I see the laws are carried out,
and those are brought to trial and to punishment
who may transgress them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But what dost thou mean by laws, Perikles?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Whatsoever the people, met together in their
Assembly, ordain, that we all must do.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Do! whether good or bad?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No; good, of course. Dost thou suppose
the people would decree that we should do the
bad?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Has every state its own assembly, then?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No; thou knowest well in Sparta, and in
other states, a few great ones make the laws,
and not the people. Hast thou not yet learnt
that at school?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes; I remember now. But what I want to
know is this: supposing a few great ones decree
what all must do, wouldst thou call that a law?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Of course I should, if the oligarchy was in
power.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But, then, suppose a tyrant, such as my
mother told me my great ancestor Kleisthenes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Sikyon was, one who took by force the power
from the people—if such a one makes a decree, is
that a law?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, in truth it is, since it is made by one who
has the power to make it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But if a tyrant came and upset our laws,
and then by force, and not by trying to persuade
the people, decreed that they must obey his will,
whether it was good or bad, would that be a law?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No, child; that would be a breaking of the
laws. I ought not to have said the orders of
a tyrant were laws, if they were made by force,
and not persuasion.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘If, then, some oligarchs should make decrees
without consulting anyone, would they be laws?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Whoever makes decrees, if they be founded
upon force, and not persuasion, I call that rather
an injustice than a law.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then, if the Athenians should impose their will
upon the rich without consulting them, would
not that be an injustice too, or would it be a
law?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Now, my good Alkibiades, go off and do thy
exercises. Boys of your age are always asking
questions. Where is Zopyros?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, Zopyros is a fool! he tells me nothing;
and when I wish to talk to the wise men, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>know the things I want to learn, he holds me back.
Other boys talk to them after their exercises at
the palaistra, and why not I?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘There is no reason why thou shouldst not,
child.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Thank you, Perikles! Thou art so busy
all day long I can scarcely ever speak of these
things to thee. And then there is that funny-looking
man who always stares at me with his
great eyes whenever I come near him; and sometimes
nearly all day long he follows me about,
but never speaks to me, and if I look at him
Zopyros hurries me away. May I not talk to
him? Other boys do, and they say, though he
looks so ugly, with his small snub nose and big
mouth, and his red face, if you hear him talk you
forget how ugly he is; and he tells them everything
they want to know, and they love to hear
him talk.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Dost thou mean Sokrates, the wisest man in
Greece?—at least, so the Oracle at Delphi said
he was.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, it is Sokrates I mean. When I was
wrestling yesterday with Antiochos he sat and
watched us all the time, but when I went to sit
upon the bench by him, he got up and went
away. Zopyros calls him a corrupter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Grecian youths, and an evil-minded sophist, and
I know not what besides. Something tells me
I should love to talk to him.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh son of Kleinias! that Sokrates can tell
thee more than I have ever dreamt of, and when
Perikles shall be no more, and all his care for
Athens, and all the battles he has fought and
won, forgotten, that strange philosopher will still
be known, through all the ages that shall come—not
here in Greece alone, but far away in other
lands which he, and you, and I, know nothing of.’</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'>A <span class='sc'>year</span> and a month have passed away. On a
warm June afternoon, escaping from Zopyros,
the boy we attempted to describe in the last
chapter had wandered by himself a short way out
of Athens. He was altered somewhat since we
saw him last. The high forehead had a more
thoughtful air, the look was more disdainful.
The face, which had given one joy to look at
from its perfect purity, now, if very slightly,
had become a little sensual. But the wonder in
the eyes was still the same—intensified. The
questioning and baffled look was there. The
desire, the determination to know, the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>will, shone out through them—‘If I don’t know
now I will some day.’</p>
<p class='c010'>Wrapt in admiration as he lay upon the grass,
gazing up to heaven and the white clouds which
passed slowly across the sky, half lulled to sleep
by the gentle gurgling of the Ilissos, in a waking
dream, a voice of deep and tender earnestness
came suddenly upon his ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>He half raised himself in haste, awakening
from his reverie, and looking round, saw Sokrates.
A deep flush came on the boy’s face when he found
himself alone before the man he had so often,
sometimes for fun indeed, but often in earnest,
declared that he would know. As he felt his
gaze fall full upon him—a look in which he saw
love, pity, admiration, all together—he blushed
with a sense of happiness, and felt a consciousness
of shame he had never known before.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, son of Kleinias and Deinomaché, have I
thus come upon you wondering when you will
get wings to fly away beyond the clouds, and
thinking you can make them for yourself, and
teach yourself to use them? Oh, foolish Daidalos,
have I not found out your thoughts?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed you have, Sokrates!’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And if I tell you how you may make these
wings to grow, what will you do for me?’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>‘I think, Sokrates, I would do anything you
asked.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But if, when you have got your wings, you
know not how to fly with them: what then?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I would do still more for you if you will teach
me how to use them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But if the way to use them is so difficult
it would take you days and nights to learn it,
and require you to give up many things you
love, and make you work and toil to get this
learning, could you do all that, think you?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed I do, if it be not too hard for me
to learn.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Which, now, gives you greater pleasure to
look upon—Perikles’ marble statue of Apollo,
or a heap of dirt?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why, how could it be but to look upon the
statue, Sokrates?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And you would rather gaze on Aspasia’s face
than on the wrinkled skin of your old paidagogos?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Of course I would.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then tell me, is it not because in Aspasia’s
face and in the statue of Apollo you see more
beauty than in Zopyros or in the dirt?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, by Zeus, it is!’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And for the soldier—is it more beautiful in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>him to die fighting for his country, or to run
away and live?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘To die, of course. I would gladly do that,
if that is all.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And for the statesman—is it not more
beautiful in him to endeavour to persuade the
people to make wise laws, and to induce them
to do wise things, though he knows they will
not love him for it, but perhaps turn on him,
and thrust him from his power, and destroy
him? Or is it better to let them do those foolish
things he knows they love, and will admire him
for advising, and so perhaps keep him a long
time in power?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘By Herakles! the first seems to me to be
more beautiful.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And these things that seem beautiful, are
they not good things too to do?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They must be good as well as beautiful. And
if I had the power I would make the people do
what is wise and beautiful.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yet you have said the statesman who would
rather lose his power than persuade the people
to the worse course was good.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I know I did.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then the beautiful and the good are one?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It seems so, Sokrates.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>‘Now I will tell thee, son of Kleinias, the wings
you long for only come to those who love and
do the beautiful and good. And they give us
pain and trouble as they try to burst forth from
the body. If you would get these wings you
must ever look upon the beautiful and do the
good, and, as I think your wish will be to lead the
people, and be chief among them, you should first
learn what is the good, and how you may persuade
them to it—and this is difficult. To do this you
must get Wisdom first yourself, and she is hard
to find. You must work at many toilsome
things. Like Herakles, you must go through
many labours, and give up much of what seems
pleasant to you now, and be content at last if,
after all this trouble, the foolish people turn you
out of power, and banish you from Athens, and
perhaps sentence you to death as a reward for
all your pains.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh Sokrates, these things seem hard you
tell me of. Is there no other way?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, you can flatter and cajole them—you
can tell them to make war when you see the
war spirit swarming like a swarm of bees among
them, though you know it is not for their good,
and will end only in a disgraceful peace; you
can advise them to ally themselves with states
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>they happen to be fond of, though you know
that others are the true friends of Athens. Then
will the changing people love you, and look upon
you as a wise counsellor, and for some time, perhaps,
you will be chief man in Athens.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy had risen up, and the two were walking
by the river-side towards the town, a cloudy
look of disappointment on the young one’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Now I will ask you one thing more,
Sokrates—a thing I have often thought about,
but never spoken it to anyone. If I could get
the wings you tell me can only be got by pain
and suffering, and by giving up the things that
I care most about, what would they do for me
when I had got them?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Did you not say you longed to rise above the
earth, and see the things beyond the sky? When
I came to you were you not feeling tired of the
earth, and yearning some day to reach the
dwellings of the gods?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, Sokrates, there it is, and this is what I
mean. Who are these gods really, and where
in heaven do they dwell? My teachers tell
me of Zeus, father of Aiakos, and I am of the
race of Aiakos. But they cannot tell me where
he is, nor the old gods before him. And
yet they were immortal too. I often wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>whither they are gone. Poems of Homer
that I love to read and hear recited say Zeus
dwells on Mount Olympos; why cannot men go
there and find him, and see the banquets of the
gods? I think these things be but idle tales,
and only Homer’s poetry, before men had our
wisdom. And if Athene really lives in the
Parthenon, why cannot I see her? Where are
the great gods, Sokrates?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They dwell not in the clouds, nor on Olympos’
top, lovely son of Kleinias! That was, but
Homer’s image. They dwell around us, and
within us, all day long. And when you feel the
strong desire to find them out, and a yearning
of your soul to see and know the gods, it is the
gods themselves within you struggling against
your lower passions, striving to give you wings
with which to fly above your small desires.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, oh, oh! hah, hah, hah! So have we
found you, Sokrates, alone with Alkibiades. And
has your daimôn thus at length permitted you
to speak to him, or is it that only now for the first
time you have found an opportunity?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Hush, Kritias and Sikias, hush! See how you
have angered Alkibiades, and sent him off blushing
and frowning in a rage.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, wisest of the Greeks, seek not to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>it seem it was our coming that has angered
Alkibiades. What were you telling him when
we came up and interrupted you? We have
been looking for you all the afternoon. Hippokrates
has a great feast to-night. Harmonidas
of Skios will be there, and a new flute-player from
Delos, and we know not who besides—but all
the greatest wits in Athens. He tells us to bid
you to his house.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, Sikias! I have feasted here already, and
at a finer feast than your Hippokrates can
make. But tell me, Kritias, or you, Sikias, son of
Sikias, would not a feast of thistles seem more
sumptuous to an ass than all the dainties of
Hippokrates?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Doubtless it would, Sokrates.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And the harsh croaking of a frog, does not
that seem more melodious to him than the flute-playing
of Harmonidas?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Perhaps it does. Why do you ask such questions?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But one more. Tell me, Kritias, to the male
frog does not his female seem more beautiful
than the face and form of Alkibiades?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I believe it does, Sokrates.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then are these things really beautiful, or do
they only seem so according to the eyes with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which we look, or the ears we listen to the sounds
withal?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I should say, Sokrates, to the frog the ugly
female seems more beautiful, because he is a
frog; as to the ass, the thistle seems the better
fare, because of his dull bestiality.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Just so, Kritias! To the dull asses who
appear to us as men the converse of the soul
with soul will ever seem a fitting theme for jest
and ridicule.’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>During</span> the fifty years which immediately preceded
the period at which we now arrive Athens
had risen from a level little higher than that of
many of her neighbour towns to be the chief,
the queen, of Hellas. Through an undiscoverable
something in her people, through an innate
power lying hid within her, through a succession
of great men to lead her, through hard work and
self-sacrifice, she had shot ahead of all her rivals.
And while boundless enterprise, which sent her
merchant vessels beyond Ionian and Aigaian Seas,
enriched her coffers, she was protected seaward
by a navy which had become a match for all
the other Grecian states together, and landward
by a solid force of soldiers, each of them a
self-relying, self-governing citizen, believing the
fate of home depended on his own peculiar
strength, courage, and obedience; and all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>compact mass by sea and land was led by
Generals not unworthy of the warriors they
commanded.</p>
<p class='c010'>So Athens was become the head of numerous
allied, almost dependent, towns and tributary
states, whose help she could call upon at need,
whose tribute flowed a constant stream to swell
her treasury. And all the time that this
material prosperity had been increasing, her
intellectual, her artistic growth had been as
wonderful. It is generally noticed that only in
the decline of nations an æsthetic, or subtle,
sense of beauty is obtained, and arts are seen
to flourish. So true has this been found in
other states and peoples that from the one the
other may often be inferred. Was this so
with Athens? Had not her arts grown with
her growth, and flourished in their full perfection
as she grew? Was it not peculiar to
Athens that they had not to wait until she was
decrepit? However this may be, we find that a
small town, as it seems to us in our days of unwieldy
cities, centres of overpeopled provinces,
a fifth-rate municipality, with a population,
even at its highest, not much greater than that
of many a modern watering-place, had bred
amongst her citizens the purest taste, and highest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>genius, that marks a people as superior to
ordinary men. And not in some only of the
higher occupations of the mind was she ahead
of others: she excelled in all. Her sculptors,
her painters, her architects, her orators, her
tragedians, her comedians, her statesmen, her
philosophers, at that time were the marvel of
the world, as it seems they will remain that
marvel for all time to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it is hard to realize the pre-eminence of
Athens in genius, who amongst us hath an
imagination large enough to realize her outward
show? Who is so vain as to attempt to picture
it to others?</p>

<p class='c010'>The city was placed just near enough to the sea
to catch its breezes and the zest of life sea-breezes
bring with them, under a sky hung higher overhead
than ours in the North appears to be; her
streets a maze of beauty with innumerable gold
and marble statues wrought by the finest sculptors
that the world has seen; her temples, public
halls and colonnades at noontide giving shade,
at evening shelter, at all times free to all; her
groves and gardens perfumed by the rich scent
of orange-trees and gayest flowers, beautiful
by day and perhaps more lovely still on moonlit
nights. And overshadowing was seen from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>every point of view the towering Akropolis,
where the maiden goddess, sprung from the
brain of Zeus, emblem and patroness of wisdom,
her calm brow half covered by her Grecian
helmet, her mighty spear in hand, stood guard
over her beloved city, its silent sentinel.</p>

<p class='c010'>But then the thronging concourse in the streets,
the busy markets, workshops, arsenals! If outward
Athens was chaste classic quietude, what a
bustling stream of life she did contain! She
had just reached the zenith of her day—everything
was prosperous. Her rival states had
been left far behind. The league of Delos,
counterplot to the Peloponnesian confederacy,
had placed Athens at its head, and Perikles was
still in power.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whenever a people has by self-restraint and
long determined toil, patience, and courage, raised
itself to wealth and greatness, the old and simple
thoughts and ways soon begin to seem too small
for them, the frugal practices of their forefathers
all too poor. So life at Athens in the heyday of
her splendour was very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at this time that the son of Kleinias—the
noble, duty-loving Kleinias, who kept aloof
from politics, and let his abler comrades rule,
while he was happy to obey the laws which others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>made, and give his strength and substance and,
at last, his life for Athens—it was at this time
the son of Kleinias approached the dawn of early
manhood. Gifted with a greater power to enjoy
the sensuous pleasures of the world than most
others have been, he had a larger intellect to
understand, a stronger will with which to keep
others in subjection. He had, too, a loftier
ambition, and every apparent means to gratify
his pride.</p>

<p class='c010'>By accident he had been placed in the highest
rank among the Athenians, if we can speak of
rank where all are equal. It was not the vulgar
rank which in our modern societies is marked
by tinkling titles, but a position willingly conceded
to the descendants of a line of heroes,
sprung originally, as men believed, from the gods
themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>His friends, his relations, were of the most
powerful amongst the citizens. The chief man
in Athens was the guardian to whose care his
father had entrusted him. Scion of a line of
frugal folk, whose wealth had long accumulated,
he had enormous riches, and owned a vast and
fertile territory. Thus he reached the golden
age when every sense is keenest, when almost
every experience brings a new delight, and each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>pulsation is a pleasure—an age we afterwards
look back upon with fond regret, not quite unmixed
with pride, and which we sadly recognise
we shall never see again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Small wonder, then, if Alkibiades threw himself
without restraint into a whirl of pleasure.
Vague longings of his boyhood were, if not forgotten,
driven out of sight. The earnest hope
of something higher lay buried underneath the
intense enjoyment of the present.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had seen little of the strange philosopher
since they met, apparently by chance, on a sunny
afternoon by the Ilissos. Sokrates was not a
Puritan. He could make allowances. But he
saw too plainly what the effect would be of
constant excess and dissipation upon a mind
like that of Alkibiades. He held aloof. He
said his daimôn, that ever-present monitor, which
told him what to do, and what to leave alone,
prevented him. Alkibiades had many friends.
Besides the sons of Perikles and other relatives
of his own age with whom he associated, there
were an abundance of parasites in Athens to
pander to his wishes. He had his studies, too.
These for the most part were in the military
schools. Through his wealth he was bound, by
the law of Athens, to serve as a knight in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>cavalry of the Athenian army, so much of his
time was taken up in learning the art of war and
military tactics. If his ambition to excel in
oratory, when he should be old enough to take
his place upon the bema, in the great Assembly
of the people, led him sometimes to the house of
Protagoras, and to other Sophists, it was rather
to learn the tricks of a quibbling debate than to
gain a knowledge of that philosophy the Sophists
pretended they were able to impart.</p>

<p class='c010'>But all such pleasant things must have an
end. The serene sky became overcast. Sparta,
fearing for her independence, and encouraged by
the Delphic oracle, determined to put her ‘whole
strength into a war’ with Athens. Korinth was
intriguing with the other states against her.
Towns and islands where oligarchies ruled hated
the democratic city, and joined in a confederacy
against her.</p>

<p class='c010'>The year 432 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> is ever to be remembered as the
beginning of the long and tedious war. Potidaia,
a Korinthian colony, on the Chalkidian coast, and
subject to Athens, was encouraged by both
Sparta and Korinth to rise against her suzerain.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the beginning of this year an expedition
was sent out by Athens, under Archestratos, with
orders to act peaceably, if possible, and to bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>back these refractory subjects at Potidaia rather
by persuasion than by actual hostilities. Archestratos,
finding peaceful overtures were of no
avail, and his force too small to coerce the revolted
town, sailed north, and made an attempt against
the Makedonians, and met with some success
there, while another larger army was prepared at
Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, then, was an opportunity for Alkibiades.
He had not yet completed his twentieth year.
By the law which regulated the military service
of the Athenian citizens, youths from eighteen to
twenty, though bound to serve, could not be
called upon to leave their country; they with
the old men formed a guard to protect the city
and the frontiers. But Alkibiades, like other less
fortunate young men, was burning with military
excitement, and with the full force of his strong
will he determined to go upon that expedition.</p>

<p class='c010'>When this busy schwärmerei is in the air
it is wonderful how infectious it becomes. The
call to arms resounded on all sides. Painting
and sculpture were neglected. Sophistic quibbling
was forgotten. Pursuit of pleasure for a
time was laid aside. Luxurious banquets, lasting
from evening far into the night, went out of
fashion. The music heard was not the wailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of the Lydian flutes, but the trumpet calling to
warlike exercise. All the world, though it knew
it not, was preparing for a war the end and
dismal consequence of which was to be terrible
to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>With flying pennants, with brave huzzas, and
gaily-decked triremes, the force set out for
Potidaia. Alkibiades had got leave to go. As
cavalry would be of little use, at what the generals
saw would most likely be a lengthy siege, none
of the golden youths could go as knights. So
many of them stayed at home. The son of
Kleinias volunteered as an ordinary hoplite, or
heavy-armed foot-soldier. And we can well
imagine the pride, the joy, with which this scion
of a stock like his would stand, with all his heavy
armour on, upon the prow of the great ship
moving grandly out to sea, as with its threefold
banks of oars it breasted the Aigaian. What
thoughts! what hopes! what exaltation! His late
excesses had been but little more than youthful
folly, and not much really cared for. Now the
descendant of Homeric heroes felt himself heroic.
Even before the Trojan War an ancestor of his
had been in the mysterious strange voyage with
Jason and the <i>Argo</i>, when all the adventurous
of the time took part in that immortal voyage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to Kolchis. He would not prove unworthy of
his sires; he would rival, and perhaps surpass,
them. He would leave behind him a fame which
should astonish men for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenian army, with their allies, under
the general Kallias, son of Kalliades, in forty
ships of war, sailed up the coast as far as Makedonia,
and there joining the army under Archestratos
that had set out some time before, and
coasting down the Shemaic Gulf, they landed
near Beroia. Then, after three days’ marching
along the shore, they encamped not far from
Potidaia, and watched the movements of the
enemy. While the army under Kallias were
joining forces with Archestratos, the Korinthians
had sent a strong detachment, under Aristeus,
to help the Potidaians, and thus the Athenians,
somewhat unexpectedly, found themselves confronted
with Korinthians, as well as Potidaians
and their Olynthian and Makedonian allies.
Aristeus was made commander-in-chief of this
formidable host. He placed the main body of
his army at the entrance to the isthmus on which
Potidaia stands, and posted the Makedonians
beneath the walls of Olynthos, in position to
attack the enemy in the rear on their first forward
movement.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Kallias, seeing this manœuvre, sent some of
his allies against the Makedonians, and gave the
signal to the main body to advance.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first onset Aristeus, with his left wing,
drove back the Athenian right, and followed
them too far as they retreated. The Athenian
left wing and centre, in which was Alkibiades,
raising their loud shout to the god of war, came
on in splendid style against the Korinthian right.
Then Greek indeed joined Greek, and fought with
more ferocious hatred in their hearts than they
had ever felt against a common foe, when, fighting
side by side, they had sent the Persian home again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Modern warfare consists, for the most part, in
well-drilled marksmen shooting at a distant mass
scarce visible, and in receiving leaden pellets from
an unseen enemy. The tug and tussle of the
old engagements, where man grappled with man,
and the final victory depended more on the
individual skill and courage of a few, is gone.
Alkibiades rushed headlong into the fray. It was
his first experience of real war. Forgetting everything
in his excitement but the antagonists
before him, he found the noblest and strongest
youths among the foe, and astonished many on
both sides as he felled opponents in his impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The Athenian attack was stubbornly resisted.
Kallias, the young general, the pupil of Zeno,
the philosopher of Elea, and a firm friend of
Alkibiades, was slain. Each foot of ground was
fought for vigorously, and fought for, sometimes,
more than once, as now Athenian, now Korinthian,
gave way, and rocked and swayed together.</p>

<p class='c010'>The son of Kleinias, blind to dangers round him,
fearless of thrusts or blows, strode in the front
of the Athenian army. He had just felled a
stalwart Korinthian, when a blow upon his
helmet, glancing down upon his breastplate,
brought him to his knees still fighting, till, with
loss of blood, he bowed his head and fell prone
upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>The battle raged around him as before. He
heard the din of it confusedly—the calling on
the gods, the cries of rage, the clanking of the
swords and shields; no one seemed to notice
him. Those who, just now, wondered at his
courage were too much engaged to see his fall.
His blood, although he knew it not, was pouring
from his wound. A dim vision of his past life
came before him—his father’s parting words, his
hopes, his ambition; now all was over, ended
at his first attempt to make a famous name.
The great gods had struck him down in his pride.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>He recollected indistinctly his late excesses,
and dread Aiakos, the Judge of Hell, he had
been used to jest about as his old ancestor in his
careless health and jollity; he trembled as he
thought how soon he was to meet him. And
then a sweet remembrance swam before his
darkening eyes of a sunny afternoon by the
Ilissos, and the pleasant voice and kindly words
of that strange friend of his came back to him,
like far-off music in his ears; then darkness, and
then—nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently a sound as of the same voice came
over him again. That which had been indistinct
and dreamy was now real and clear. His eyes
opened, and he saw Sokrates striding across him,
his big eyes shining with a rage which made
them look almost beautiful; the ungraceful body
trembled with a god-like energy, his whole
countenance glowed as if inspired. With a blow
he had brought to the ground a Potidaian,
who, taking advantage of the young man’s
helplessness, was about to slay him with his
sword.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenian army, everywhere victorious,
chased the enemy into Potidaia, and left the
young hoplite and the philosopher behind
amongst the dead and dying. Neither of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>spoke: one was too weak, the other only stood
and watched him.</p>

<p class='c010'>When some of their side returned, Alkibiades
was taken to his tent, and his wound was dressed.
Youth, vigour, and relenting Zeus soon did the
rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amidst rejoicing and loud hymns of triumph
to the God of War, with which the Athenians
celebrated their success, the generals deliberated,
according to their wont, to whom the prize of
valour should be given. They decided on the
favourite Alkibiades, already celebrated for his
wealth and beauty and now made famous by
his prowess. Alkibiades refused, and with true
generosity declared that Sokrates, the saviour of
his life, deserved it more than he did. But the
generals cared little for the philosopher, so Alkibiades
was afterwards crowned with laurel and
invested with a splendid suit of armour before
the assembled host, as hero of the victorious day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile he was not ungrateful. He had
made Sokrates come back with him and share
his tent as long as he remained in the besieging
camp. His wound, though quickly healing, left
behind it a sense of lassitude he had never felt
before. He had time to study the strange
character, and many an occasion to marvel at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the curious man who was living with him in the
close confines of a soldier’s tent. He loved to
gaze on the grotesque figure, and listen to his
words, which had about them a charm unspeakable,
and carried all away who listened to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes Sokrates remained lost in thought
for hours—all the whole day together—undisturbed
by the tumult of the camp, or by the wit and
frolic of the younger men who thronged the tent.
But Alkibiades cared less than heretofore for the
gay society of his companions. He would often
rather sit and learn, answering the perpetual
questionings by which the sage, humblest of
men himself, would show how ignorant men are,
how puffed up only by conceit of knowledge,
how appearances are taken by them for realities,
how even those who pass for the wisest of mankind,
when brought to book, give but the poorest
explanation of the simplest things, how those
only are truly wise who know their utter,
necessary ignorance.</p>

<div class='lh'>

<p class='c019'>‘Alas! unnumbered sorrows do I suffer</p>
<p class='c020'> A plague is on all our host, nor can thought find any weapon of defence.</p>
<p class='c020'> One on another mayest thou see urged on like bird on well-plumed wing,
swifter than the resistless flame, to the shore of the god of darkness.</p>

unpitied upon the ground, with none to make lament for them.’</p>
<div class='c021'><span class='sc'>Sophocles</span>: <i>Oid. Tyran.</i></div>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Through</span> all that winter, and long after it, the
siege of Potidaia lasted. Sokrates showed superhuman
power of endurance, keeping his watch
by night barefoot amid the ice and snow, in his
only dress, which he wore summer and winter,
in heat and cold alike, in the pelting rain and
bitter winds. He showed endurance, too, in
striving to win his scholar to a higher life, to
nobler aims.</p>
<p class='c010'>But Alkibiades in time grew tired of the siege.
It was very well to do heroic deeds before the
eyes of men, but to sit down before a stubborn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>town, month after month to go through the same
tedious duties, without a chance of honour or
distinction, that was a different thing. The siege
got wearisome. With returning health and
strength he began to long for the pleasures he
had left behind at Athens. Moreover, the pest
broke out amongst the besiegers and besieged.
So he got leave, like many others, to return.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he got back an awful change had come
over the gay city. He had left it in its glory,
triumphing in bravery and beauty; he came back
to find it a place of mourning. The pest had
come there, too, making havoc among the citizens,
whose numbers were swelled by almost the whole
rural population of the state. For the Lakedaimônian
invasion of Attika had forced the
country people into Athens, where they lay
huddled up together in miserable hovels, in
temples, in the porticos and colonnades. And
the plague raged amongst them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Men and women, old and young, and helpless
children, all alike—the plague spared none of
them. Rich and poor were doomed to the same
fearful suffering. A burning torture took possession
of their bodies, and defied all remedies.
Physicians’ skill was of no avail. The plague
demon baffled every precaution. Those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>could get away left Athens, and many of them
fell victims as they went, unhelped, uncared for
by panic-stricken friends. In the town those
who were forced to stay sat down in grim despair,
waiting their turn for torture and for death.</p>

<p class='c010'>A black veil hung over the gorgeous city. Like
a faded beauty who long ago had decked herself
out with ornaments and shone resplendent
in her youth, the ornaments were there, the
beauty gone—it seemed for ever. The dismayed
people, who were stricken with a fever the like
of which had not been seen before, and which
has passed, as the Greeks themselves have passed,
from earth, wallowed in their pain. They rushed
to pools, to streams, to fountains, and in delirious
feebleness fell headlong in and died. The waters
thus polluted were a source for propagating the
disease. The very water, gift of purity and
cleanliness, became the channel of a loathsome
death. An internal fire ate out the very core
of life. A scream for drink, more drink, to quench
the unextinguishable flame, which burnt from
head to foot, through all the limbs, but most
through the more vital parts, was heard above
the wails and groans—was heard unheeded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even when recovery was possible the terrible
phenomenon was seen of human beings who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>lost all memory of everything that had gone
before, all remembrance of their friends, all consciousness
of the continuity of their existence, of
their own names.</p>

<p class='c010'>The birds and beasts that prey on human
bodies and thrive on such occasions disappeared,
either through disgust and satiety, or killed by
the infection. Even the women, tender nurses in
distress, who know so well how to soothe our pains,
when we can scarce tell what we want, whose
constant care will watch and help when we are
powerless—even women fled in horror from those
stricken by that plague. There was none to
help; there was little aid that could do any good.
Nemesis, for all the too great pride and joy of
Athens, poured forth the vials of her retribution.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades had, indeed, an opportunity to
show how he had profited by the lessons of his
friend. He had no fear and great generosity.
Among the few who rose above the degrading
influence of the terrible contagion no one was
more active or persevering than was he. Undaunted
by the weight of woe with which he
had to deal, he attacked the unseen enemy as
resolutely as he had fought Korinthians at
Potidaia. While most men slunk away in dread,
and others, despairing of their lives, sought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>enjoy the short time left them in unsatisfying
dissipation, and affected to ignore the danger by
an assumed carelessness or noisy drunkenness,
he was unwearied in the aid he brought to the
panic-stricken people. The rich who had not
fled barricaded themselves in their large houses,
hoping thus to escape the plague, and many
expired there alone. It was not to these he
came, but to the poor, who had no palaces in
which to stand a siege, to the poor, crowded
together in their small tenements, lying helpless
on their straw.</p>

<p class='c010'>The poorer Athenian was accustomed to spend
the greater part of his day out of doors. As soon
as he rose in the early morning, putting on his
simple dress, he was out in the fresh air. His
work was done there; there he enjoyed his mid-day
rest. If he was summoned to take part in
the Assembly of the state, it was in the open air
he heard and voted. If he had to try a fellow
citizen, it was in a court roofed only by the canopy
of heaven. Or when, his work and duty done,
he assisted at a play of Sophokles or the broad
satire of a comedy, it was under the blue sky he
listened and applauded.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in unaccustomed confinement that these
Greeks lay dying when Alkibiades came, bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>consolation and the sunlight of his radiant
happiness. How many in after-years, in the
conflict of party strife, when it was their turn
to vote for or against him, remembered the god-like
youth, who in the flush of strength, and
victory, and beauty, had come like Hermes to
them in their agony?</p>

<p class='c010'>When he returned from Potidaia, he found
other troubles disturbing the democratic city.
The people, dissatisfied with the conduct of the
war, and maddened by the plague, turned on their
best friend. Perikles, who had subdued the
oligarchs, had raised the people to power, had
endowed them with the privileges they enjoyed,
and had for thirty years guided the popular government
of the state so wisely and so strongly that
most even of his oligarchic opponents were contented
with his guidance, was now the object
of the people’s anger.</p>

<p class='c010'>We can imagine the thoughts with which the
old man came home from the Assembly which
decreed his degradation and his punishment.
He had made Athens what she was. He had
guarded her from foes without, the people from
their foe within, ever ready to rob them of
their rights. It was in his mind that had first
risen up the idea of a great Hellenic empire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>one confederation, which should include all the
self-governing states and towns of Greek origin,
with Athens at its head. It had been his hope
to call together a pan-Hellenic congress, to
consider the rights, the wrongs, the divergent
interests, of them all, that they might proceed
together, self-defended from barbarian attack,
to higher intellectual and ethic greatness, to
even nobler efforts in their arts and in their
literature—a policy which, had he been allowed
an opportunity to carry it out unto its end, must
have gone near to realize the great ideal of his
hopes, and would certainly have saved Athens
and the whole of Greece from the catastrophe
which was now about to be unfolded.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was as a symbol of imperial headship that
he had caused Athens to be decorated with the
splendid monuments that arose within the city in
his time. And now, awakening from his dream
of what she—what all Greece—might have been,
he found Athens threatened upon every side,
and himself marked by her people as the victim
for their sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Harder blows came on him nearer home. He
had seen his old companions, his colleagues, pass
away. The plague bore off his only sister, then
his eldest son, and then his Paralos, his youngest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>best beloved. As the old man placed the funeral
wreath upon that head, the emotion he had mastered
hitherto quite mastered him; he fell down,
overwhelmed with woe. The human mass which
ruled in Athens, even they were touched at that
sad spectacle. The people recollected what he
had done for them, for Athens; they called their
leader back to power as suddenly as they had
driven him away.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Perikles was broken down. He felt his
sun was setting. His far-reaching plans had
failed. He longed for peace and for silent converse
with his sorrow. Alkibiades, the bright,
the rising sun, came to his old friend and tutor,
whose glory was departing, and, after much persuasion,
induced the old warrior and chief to
return to lead the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>Once more he heard the shouts of gratulation
as he raised a trembling arm and swayed them
as of old. Once more his eyes, grown dim with
age and grief, saw the vast sea of faces gazing
at him as he kept the huge concourse silent with
his word. But the elasticity was gone. The
heart within him rose not as it had used to do.
His day was done. Within another year the
greatest of Greek statesmen was taken, not reluctantly,
to his last resting-place. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>world, save for the undying works he left behind
him, went on as though he had not been.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conflicting forces rose at once. Oligarchs
and democrats, headed by Nikias and Kleon,
contended for the prize the dead leader had
abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nikias, representing the rich old families, and
supported by them, was of high birth and wealthy.
He was timid, cautious, safe and superstitious,
narrow-minded, honest, and respectable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kleon was of the middle, trading class. Many
of this sort, during the last thirty years of prosperity,
had become wealthy. He was the first
who presumed to bid for power. It is one of
the strange phenomena of nature that after
pestilence comes great fecundity. This has often
been observed, especially after the plague which
ravaged Europe in 1348 and 1349 of our era.
The air is cleared, as it were, by the storm which
has passed over. Those who survive, too, get
to themselves such courage they begin to imagine
they are exempt from ordinary dangers. They
become rich with the wealth of those who have
died, and rejoice in a new and opulent existence.
At Athens life burst out anew in the fulness of
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c010'>None knew how to enjoy it more than Alkibiades.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>We need not dwell upon the life he led
for the next few years. His mind, his ambition,
was expanding. He was nearing the age when
he should take his share in the government of
the Athenian empire. He had enriched his mind
with all the knowledge of the Greeks at the
highest period of their culture. Nature had
endowed him with a genius to discover the right
course to take in every emergency, as if by intuition;
so that, apparently without effort, he
divined the course events would take. In him
she joined courage and resource with a circumspect
solicitude seldom found together with
promptness in action.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had given him besides a body of so much
strength and beauty, and withal of so great grace,
that sculptors, who, while he was a boy, had
realized at sight of him the face and form of
Eros, God of Love, now took him as their model
when they strove to mould a Hermes, the wise,
quick, strong, radiant messenger of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>If we dare not linger on the life he led at this
time, if we can only speculate on some of the
motives of his conduct, neither can we venture
to describe his outward form, the perfect oval
of his face, the thickly curling hair he allowed
to grow so long, the large voluptuous eyes, now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>gazing with half-closed indolence, now flashing
with the latent fire within, the faultless classic
profile, the clean-cut nose, with nostrils that
would sometimes dilate and tremble with excitement,
above a mouth which often stayed half
opened, careless in repose, and sometimes withering
in its contempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>Can we wonder if, in the graphic language of
the Greek historian, ‘he was hunted by good
women, as the hunter hunts his prey’? Ought
we to be hard in our judgment on him if, living
before the world had yet been taught a higher
law, his life was not what we call virtuous? If
we do not pardon him, we can make excuses.
We cannot but remember the circumstances of
his youth and bringing up in the house of
Perikles and Aspasia; the licence of affection
unsanctioned by the marriage tie, which even
severe critics like Sokrates did not condemn. Of
all this liberty he took his fill. None so sought
after as he, none sooner weary of ordinary easy
love. He astonished Athens by his erratic escapades.
He had all there at his command. That
was not enough. Hearing of renowned beauties
far away, the difficulties of the pursuit lent
enchantment to the search. At one time we hear
of him, in disguise, at Korinth, at another at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Abydos in the Hellespont, drawn thither only by
rumour of the beauty of Medontis.</p>

<p class='c010'>So three years went by as in a wanton dream.
As Perikles had for his friend the learned and
beautiful Aspasia, whose salon was frequented
by the wit and genius of Greece, so his pupil
formed a strong attachment to Timandra, and
felt perhaps the truest love he ever felt for the
fair Athenian. She, like Aspasia, was of the class
which society at that time something more than
tolerated. Doubtless she was fitter to become
companion of the life and work of such a man,
the confidante of his hopes and aspirations, than
were the most part of the high-born Grecian
ladies. We shall see how faithfully, through all
his ills, she followed him unto the end. But the
offspring of such alliances could not become
their fathers’ heirs, except by special legislation,
so Alkibiades must marry, and marry one of his
own caste.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rich and famous general Hipponikos,
whose ancestors were among the most famous
mythic heroes of the Greeks, whose family were
the hereditary torch-bearers at the celebration
of the Eleusinian mysteries, had an only daughter,
Hippareté, whom he loved devotedly, and who
was to share his wealth. Her hand was eagerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>sought for by most of the young men of old
descent. The fact that she was coveted by
many enhanced her value in the eyes of Alkibiades.
She whom so many were anxious to
possess was worth pursuing. He found in that
pursuit an opportunity to show how he could
excel the other youthful heroes of the day in
love as well as war.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her mother had been separated from Hipponikos
by the odious law which allowed a wife for
little cause to change her husband for another—the
bane and fruitful source of evil in the old
societies. Released from her first husband, she
had married Perikles, and became the mother
of some of his children; but growing jealous of
Aspasia, she was divorced from Perikles, and
joined herself in wedlock to a third. It was the
daughter of this woman and Hipponikos that
Alkibiades wooed and won—perhaps too easily.</p>

    <div>‘HYMEN O HYMENAIE’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>In</span> the late autumn of 425 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, when the keen
bright winter was just beginning to give warning
that he was coming soon, Alkibiades brought his
young bride home to his great house in the heart
of Athens. First came the bearer of the marriage
torch, which had been lighted by Deinomaché;
then the chorus of youths and maidens dancing,
and shouting to the shrill reedy music of the
double oboes their thrilling and exulting cry,
‘Hymen O Hymenaie!’ then bride and bridegroom
on the wedding-car, drawn by four white
horses of his breed that was to become so famous.</p>
<p class='c010'>A flight of steps led up to the wide portico,
supported by six Ionic columns, crowned by its
sculptured tympanum, on this day hung with
garlands. The massive doors, covered with
beaten bronze plates, were opened as the festive
band approached, and showed a troop of slaves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>young men and maidens, upon either side,
awaiting the arrival of their lord. The bridal
procession entered the great courtyard, which
had been much changed and ornamented since
the days of Kleinias. A colonnade of sculptured
columns now ran all round it; the walls were
painted with scenes from the Argonautic expedition
by the young painter Mikôn. A graceful
fountain rose and fell in the centre of the court
as they passed through to the rooms beyond,
painted for this occasion with hymeneal subjects
by Aristophôn. There the women had prepared
the nuptial couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Athens was astir that day. All the world knew
Alkibiades, and had heard many things of the
riches and the ancestry of the daughter of Hipponikos.
Slaves and dependents, from the
demesnes of either house, followed in their train.
Hipponikos was proud at having for his son-in-law
one who had proved his valour in the field,
and bade fair by his talents to become a leading
man in Athens. The people lined the streets to
see the show, and cheered their favourite as
he went by as heartily as they applauded when
the actors, in their great masks, mouthed out
licentious satires of him on the comic stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the rich feast which Hipponikos gave, friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and relations of bride and bridegroom, and most
of the great men of the state, were present.
Kallias, the brother of the bride, of course was
there, with his philosopher Protagoras, and others
of his loquacious Sophist friends, and Sokrates,
who never spoke a word. The banquet, gay and
joyous, with its great dishes of sesame cakes,
lasted late, and then the bride bid adieu to her
old sire, and left her home of innocence and
peace, happiest of them all, unmindful of the
troubles that were to come with the new life.</p>

<p class='c010'>She thought that she indeed had cause to be
contented. She had gained the bravest, cleverest,
most splendid of all the Greeks. Even his gallantries,
of which her women told her, could not
lessen the admiration that she felt, and all these
gallantries, excusable in him till now, she knew
he would abandon for the love of her. Had she
not cause to be contented?</p>

<p class='c010'>And he, as the epithalamium he had written
for her was sung outside their chamber door by
girls and boys, to the music of the harps and
flutes—he, tired with the day’s excitement, as
he laid him down by her, he too was happy,
while Timandra—poor Timandra!—was almost
forgot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lonely Timandra, who had given up all else
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>for him, and loved him as only such a one as she
can love, in her fair Grecian villa—far from the
bustle of the town, she sat her down in dark
despair and rage. The very luxury with which
he had surrounded her grew hateful to her. The
garden perfumes from the orange-trees, whose
blossoms the late autumn winds had not yet
shaken off, grew sickly. The shaded seats, where
they had sat on summer nights, looked drear.
The birds, which had so often sung to them in
the bright springtime, on quiet cloudless evenings,
their songs of love and endless happiness,
were still. All, all, was desolate.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had sometimes feared this end. And yet
what fault was it of hers that she was not descended
from as long a line of ancestors as this
Hippareté? Was her rival any better for her
trip to Samos, and all the other childish myths
about her family? Perhaps her own forefathers—who
could tell?—had been as great as that
one’s. Her mother—and now she almost wept—her
kind, fond, virtuous mother, who had died
hardly forgiving her, she, at least, was better
than that poor doll’s, with three husbands living
at one time. She was more beautiful, she knew,
than poor Hippareté, for he had often told her
so; and she had wit and learning, and was more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>skilled in every art than any woman in her time,
except, perhaps, Aspasia.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the day passed with her. When the night
came on, a maddening frenzy seized her soul, till
the chill morning dawned, and then an evil
smile crept over her disdainful mouth; she
knew her time would come.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a season Alkibiades became another man.
He laid aside the flowing Persian robe in which
he loved to scandalize the sterner Greeks. The
long and curling locks, tokens of youth, were
cut at last. His days again were given to military
exercise, and sometimes he would even seek out
Sokrates, and listen to his teaching. The faithful
Sokrates had never ceased to follow him through
all his dissipation, had never ceased to love
him for his beauty and his understanding, nor
ceased to mourn for him as over a great soul
departing.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the spring drew on there was greater martial
stir than ever in the town of Athens. It was
indeed a time for all who cared for her or wished
to make a name to brace themselves for action.
Besides Korinthian, Spartan, and other Doric
enemies in the Peloponnesos, Boiotians to the
north, Megarians on the west, were threatening
her. Now was the moment come for struggle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>if she meant to burst the toils that were closing
round about her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like Venice afterwards, and another island
in the north, Athens found her chief ally in the
sea-waves. On the sea she still ruled despotic.
The sea was Athens’ true divinity, the highway
of her commerce and her armies, her protection
from her enemies. To the sea, it was said,
the tribune in her Assembly turned as to a
deity.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The remains of it show this was not so.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c010'>A desultory warfare had been going on with
varying success since the victory at Potidaia.
Kleon, who had succeeded to something of the
popularity and something of the political wisdom
of Perikles, had, by a lucky chance, increased his
reputation by vanquishing the Spartans and
taking many of them prisoners at Sphakteria,
when Nikias had refused to go there.</p>

<p class='c010'>To prevent and put a stop for ever to the
frequent ravages of Attika by Lakedaimôn, aided
by Boiotian cavalry, it was determined to make
a final stand, and by a sudden incursion on
Boiotia to gain so strong a position within its
borders that invasion thence should be impossible
in future. A levy was made of nearly
all who could bear arms, and the largest expedition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>ever yet sent out was ready to march, under
Hippokrates, in September, 424.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sokrates served with the heavy-armed. Hipponikos
was placed over a portion of the force,
while Alkibiades was foremost, gayest, best
equipped of all the knights.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was enthusiastic for the war, but Hippareté
was plunged in terror as the time drew near for
his departure; and, on the day before he left,
she gave birth, too early, to their first-born son.
Hipponikos was overjoyed at the event, doubled
the large dowry he had given her, then bade
farewell to the beloved daughter he was not to
see again, and Alkibiades kissed tenderly the
wife he had to part from in her weakness and
foreboding.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever solicitude he may have felt at leaving
his young wife at such a time, it was soon forgotten
as he rode off along the way the traveller
still takes who journeys from Athens to the
ruined Delion. Nor did the beauty of the road
which goes through olive woods near home to
the mountain passes of Pentelikos and Parnes,
on to Oropos, and so, by the sea-shore, to where
the temple of Apollo overhung, from its high
rock, the surging sea below, make much impression
on him then.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>When they arrived in the enemy’s country,
three days were spent in fortifying the temple
and throwing up entrenchments. This point was
of great strategic value. If the Athenians could
keep it, they would have a fortress on the frontier
of Boiotia, inside their neighbours’ territory,
whence so many invasions had of late years come
upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hippokrates, having finished his entrenchments,
and having placed there a small force of foot and
horse for the defence of the newly-acquired fortress,
ordered the main body to return to Attika. The
light-armed went first, and had got safely across
the frontier before the heavy-armed and the
cavalry had left the temple. Hippokrates stayed
behind, for a time, at Delion. The hoplites and
the cavalry, after a rapid march, halted on the
frontier, about a mile from Oropos. They were
about to start again, after a short rest, when, late
in the afternoon, a herald from Hippokrates
galloped up in haste with orders to range themselves
at once in line of battle, for the forces of
Boiotia and her allies, twenty thousand men,
fresh and eager for the fight, were coming over
the hills to fall upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hippokrates, who soon came up, had not
eight thousand men, all told, to meet this unexpected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>blow, and they were tired out with marching.
The general got them into some sort of
order, and was addressing them, pointing out the
immense importance of gaining a foothold in
Boiotia, to stop the incursions the Spartans, with
the help of the Theban cavalry, were able continually
to make upon the soil of Attika, when
he was interrupted by the war-cry of Boiotia,
and the Boiotians and their confederate forces
were upon them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenians rushed to meet them. They
were only eight men deep; the Thebans were
twenty-five. The shock was terrible. The
Athenian right wing, throwing itself on the
Boiotian left, where the Thespians fought, drove
it back, and cut the Thespians to pieces. But
they went too far, and got involved with the
deep columns of the enemy, and lost as many
as they slew.</p>

<p class='c010'>On their left wing the Athenians were broken
at the onset, and retreated, overpowered by
numbers. The centre and so much of the right
wing as could disengage themselves followed in
good order. But as they turned the hillside
they saw the Boiotian cavalry, fifteen hundred
strong, charging down upon them. They broke
and fled in all directions. Some made their way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>back to Delion, others to the sea at Oropos;
others, struggling through the passes of Parnes,
at last got home again to Athens. The enemy,
pursuing them, did fearful execution in their
ranks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Brave old Hipponikos was slain at the beginning
of the rout while endeavouring to rally his retreating
men. From the hilly nature of the
ground where the main attack had been delivered,
the small force of cavalry, placed at each
extremity of the Athenian line, had been unable
to give much help during the heat of the conflict.
That division of the horse posted on the left
wing, where Alkibiades chafed at his compulsory
inaction, covered, as far as it could, the disorderly
retreat. While thus engaged, it was his good
fortune to save the life of Sokrates, and so repay
the service his friend had rendered him seven
years before at Potidaia. He came upon him
retiring with his face to the Boiotians as calmly
as if he had been combating some common error
in the groves at Athens. Misfortune ever made
more manifest the greatness that was in him.
The rugged figure had a majesty about it as he
bade defiance to the foe. Death when threatened
by his country’s enemies brought no more fear to
him than when at last it came to him in the cup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of hemlock, by which that country afterwards
rewarded him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The temple at Delion was soon afterwards retaken
by the Boiotians, and that disastrous
campaign was ended. At the same time in
Thrace the Spartans, under Brasidas, were encouraging
Athenian dependencies to revolt.
Through the negligence of the historian Thoukydides
they were able to take Amphipolis, one
of the most important possessions of Athens on
the Thrakian coast, an event which became of
curious importance in deciding the future life of
Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had returned to Athens in less glorious
circumstances than those in which he had set
out. Through no fault of his, he and the other
knights had been unable to do much. He was
discontented. His wife received him back with
tears. He who was almost all to her had come
back indeed, but the brave old father, where was
he? Her father had ever been her constant
friend, the dear companion of her childish days
and early womanhood. When his wife left him
his daughter had become everything to him. He
lavished all his love on her, for the worthless
Kallias deserved and got but little. And he who
gave it to her so ungrudgingly was gone. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>would never see that strong old tender face again.
How could she keep her tears from flowing—tears
of grief, tears, too, of joy, as her husband
stood by her side once more?</p>

<p class='c010'>Egoism, from which most men, even the
best, suffer more or less, was not a stranger in
the breast of Alkibiades. He liked the blind
devotion of his wife, and would not have her
show her grief for anyone when he was there.
He did not understand how much less worth
her love for him must be if she did not love her
father with another and as great a love.</p>

<p class='c010'>He grew weary of his life at home. Hippareté
was rather dull. She was weak and feeble, and
spent most of her time attending to her child.
His absences from home grew longer and more
frequent. When he came there she met him
with a grieved, sad smile. Silent reproaches
drove him off again.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>It</span> was towards the end of May, in the year 423,
that Kleon gave his celebrated banquet to his
friends. His house was large and sumptuous
rather than beautiful. Βάναυσον is the word
which best describes the feast, for which ‘vulgarly
profuse’ is our nearest equivalent. Not that
Kleon was altogether what we call a vulgar man.
It may be doubted if there was anything known
in Greece at that time which we can exactly
qualify by the term ‘vulgarity.’ Yet his peculiarities
had something akin to that growth of
vulgar profusion in later times which came to its
perfection in the rich outside society of later
Rome, and has not yet entirely disappeared.</p>
<p class='c010'>Kleon was a man of considerable power. He
had shown sound judgment and natural military
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>skill at Sphakteria, where, although unused to
arms, he struck the first blow at the military
supremacy of Sparta, while, as a politician, during
the short time in which he took a leading part in
the guidance of the state, he proved himself to
be one of the most sagacious and far-sighted of
Grecian statesmen.</p>

<p class='c010'>True, he threw aside the old traditions of the
Pnyx, the Athenian House of Commons, as he
threw aside his cloak, or let it fall ungracefully
from off his shoulders, as he tramped about the
tribune. True, his harangues there were not the
stately orations of academic Athens. True, he
swelled his cheeks when he thundered out the
living words which took such hold upon the
people, chiefly because they were the expressed
embodiment, the unconscious echo, of their own
vague thoughts. Yet was there something in his
voice—a ring in it—which spake of genius more
than of vulgarity. And though his enemies
could ridicule his speeches afterwards, and demonstrate
the errors in his arguments to small batches
of adherents in the Agora, few dare raise their
voice to answer him in the Assembly of the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>He loved the large and splendid in his house
and at his entertainments, and there was plenty
of the large and splendid at this feast. There
was also serious conversation. The times were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>critical. The two great states of Greece felt a
desire for peace. Athens had suffered terribly
at Delion, and since then some other of the
Thrakian cities dependent upon her had seized
the opportunity to shake off her yoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if Athens had suffered much, Sparta, on
the whole, had suffered more, and with less power
to recuperate, for this is the weakness of an
exclusive people such as the Spartans were.
Like the Patriciate of Rome, they would admit
no strangers to share their privileges. So if a
generation of her men were weakened, or, as
happened sometimes, well-nigh destroyed by
war, she had to wait for another generation to
grow up to supply the loss. Not so at Athens.
There the gaps made in her ranks were constantly
repaired by new-made citizens, who soon
caught the spirit of the old Athenian traditions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sparta no less than Athens wished for peace.
But the treaty which had been made for one year,
now just expired, had hardly been concluded
before news came that Skione, a thriving town
not far from Potidaia, had thrown off her allegiance
to Athens, and had invited Brasidas, the
Spartan commander in that part, who had taken
Amphipolis, to come to help her, and that Brasidas
was assisting her in her revolt.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Now, the treaty had provided that both sides
and their dependencies should remain throughout
the year as they were at the making of the
treaty. Sparta declared the revolt of Skione
had taken place before the treaty was concluded.
Athens answered that to assist the Skionians was
to infringe the terms of the treaty, as at the
making of it Skione was a dependency of hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>This questionable conduct of Sparta was the
chief topic of conversation at Kleon’s banquet.
Then there was the loss of Amphipolis, which the
more warlike thought must be recovered at any
cost. Some were for moderation, most of the
guests for war. Kleon, having sounded the
general feeling of his friends, was, on the whole,
for war.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke of the duty of all men, at any price,
to save their country’s honour and preserve the
state’s integrity. He denounced the perfidy of
Sparta, and declared if Nikias, to whose negligence
in confiding the Thrakian colonies to the
government of the money-making Thoukydides
the loss of Amphipolis was due—if Nikias feared
to meet Brasidas in the field, why, he would go
himself and bring the Spartans back prisoners to
Athens, as he had done before, when Nikias
shirked his duty at Sphakteria.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Most of his guests noisily applauded him. A
few were doubtful. They had not much faith
in the enterprise or ability of Nikias, who had
already been sent to the north to recover the
lost Chalkidian towns, and had returned with but
little glory, yet they had still less confidence
in the military knowledge of Kleon; while all
recognised in Brasidas one of the greatest generals
that Sparta had as yet produced. The poorer
sort were all for war. War hit their rich and
aristocratic opponents most, while the middle
class often sucked no small advantage from a
war.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shining among them all was Alkibiades, gayest
in wit, quickest in repartee. He was looked
upon by both parties as the coming man amongst
the younger men, and as one who must make
his mark when, in a short time, he would be of
age to take his part in the Athenian Parliament.
But when the question of war was seriously
discussed, he either affected carelessness or professed
a desire to hear his elders speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the traditions of the family, from his
education, he was on the people’s side. Still,
he was a knight, and very rich. His personal
friends were chiefly of the knightly order, and
on the other side in politics. They were nicer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to associate with than democrats like Kleon and
his friends. They had been, too, his comrades,
and had fought beside him in the wars. Moreover,
Sokrates, in whose wisdom he had great
faith, was for the oligarchic party.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both sides were anxious to get hold of him.
He was too wise to compromise his future liberty.
He had not yet determined on which side the
better chances of distinction lay, or, indeed, which
side was absolutely best for Athens. Kleon undoubtedly
was the first man among the democrats—it
would be difficult to oust him from his position.
On the other hand, Nikias, though safe,
was feeble and irresolute; there were already
many secret murmurs against him, even from
among his own party, both as a politician and a
general.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the feast and high debate were over,
these were the thoughts which strove together
in his mind, as, after bidding Kleon and his fellow
guests good-night, he dismissed his slave and
walked alone towards home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Warm with wine, excited by the discussion
he had heard, he wandered on, thinking of his
future course in life. Who was there to guide
him? There was Sokrates indeed, but Sokrates
was all for Sparta and for peace.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Sokrates cared little for the oligarchic faction.
Most of them, he said, knew not how to govern
themselves, or persuade each other on the simplest
questions; how could they govern others, or
persuade the people as to what was best for
their most vital interests? He had little regard
for the oligarchs of Athens. But, anyhow, they
were better than the mob. They had more to
lose. And even they, foolish as they were, even
they were more likely to go right in their opinions
than the fickle populace, with their wavering, half-formed
wishes. Alkibiades knew the advice he was
sure to get from his old adviser. Then there was
Hippareté, who, like the other women of her rank,
had been brought up in respectable seclusion,
knew scarcely anything beyond a few domestic
duties, and cared only for her husband and her
child.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lost in his thoughts, his steps took him unconsciously
from the homeward road, from the
main streets, along a way they knew well, and
which still seemed as natural to him as that which
led to the house of his forefathers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Descending the hill of the nymphs, where
Kleon’s house stood, he made towards the Agora.
The moon was nearly at its full, the streets were
silent. It is difficult for us to realize a wide-spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>city, gardens, temples, porches, statues,
lit at night only by the moon. The absence
of public lights at night, the scarceness of light
in private houses after sunset, accustomed the
citizens, especially the poor, to rise at earliest
dawn, so as to make as much as possible of the
daytime, and to go to rest at an earlier hour
than the inhabitants of our gas-illuminated cities
care to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had met few people, when he found himself
already beyond the Stoa Poikile, where Mikôn’s
paintings of Ajax and Kassandra showed plainly
in the moonlight, and the new statue of Hermes
just finished by Nikeratos, for which, as all men
knew, that incomparable sculptor had taken
the son of Kleinias as his model. Then he passed
through the Agora, the great market-place of
Athens, and by the Stoa Eleutheros, and on and
on he scarce knew where, he scarce cared to know
for certain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Skirting the Mouseion hill, the road led to
the Ilissos. A young girl, starting suddenly from
behind the temple of Aphrodite, startled him;
he wondered at his weakness. She was soon
out of sight. He turned the corner by the
Amazonian monument, and then, there by the
river, there in its pleasant garden, there it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>before him, but long unvisited, the pretty villa he
had himself planned for Timandra.</p>

<p class='c010'>The akanthos plants had grown since he saw
them last; the jasmine, just bursting into blossom,
half hid the well-known door. These small things
stamped themselves upon his memory as he paused
a moment and looked round him, he knew not
why; then he knocked nervously. The old slave
he had given her opened to him, and laid her
finger on her lips. He crossed the tiny atrium,
entered the chamber painted in deep-red colours.
The lamp of curious workmanship, which he had
brought from Lesbos, shed a soft light upon
the walls. A draped Hebe, cup in hand, was
painted on one wall, an undraped Ganymede
upon the other, and leaning against the pedestal
of a statue of Eros stood Timandra.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was gazing through the small portico out
upon the orange-trees and myrtles; across them
shone the moon. Her golden hair was bound
up in a knot behind; the flowing robe hung down
in graceful folds, and only half concealed her
figure. On the tripod table near her—the well-known
tripod table, with the three satyrs for its
legs—lay rolls of writing: the fifth book of the
‘Odyssey,’ and her favourite Anakreon in its
purple case. He walked up silently and placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>his hand upon her. Without a sign of wonder,
she turned and looked full into his eyes. There
was no reproach, no astonishment, as she leant
her head upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I was expecting you,’ she said; ‘something
told me you would come.’</p>

<p class='c010'>They sat down on the couch, and then, all
gaiety, she said how she had often heard from
Aspasia how busy he had been with his affairs.
She had but seldom been of late, however,
to see Aspasia. She could not understand
how one who had been the friend of Perikles
could take up with a man like Lysicles,
so burly and so common, whose talk was of
his oxen, and his thoughts no better than his
talk.</p>

<p class='c010'>And then she told how Sokrates had been to
see her. ‘Extraordinary man!’ At first, she
said, she wondered what he came for, he asked
so many curious questions—how she had gained
the love of such a one as Alkibiades, and many
other things. And then she mimicked Sokrates,
and tried to imitate his eyes and mouth, till her
fond lover stopped her.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And yet there was much wisdom in it all,’
she said; ‘and when he talked of you and told
me how you saved his life at Delion, he grew quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>eloquent. I thought I could have listened to
him all day long.’</p>

<p class='c010'>And so she prattled on, as though he had never
left her, full of wit and life and loveliness. The
night was fresh and bright, and, as he sat gazing
at her once more, a feeling of contentment and
delight stole over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three days he stayed with her, bound by the
old chain of love. On the fourth morning she
told him he must go, and, after the slight morning
meal, she bade him farewell—‘for a time,’
she said, as bright and cheerful as on the day
when he came back to her; and he went somewhat
reluctantly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>His thoughts were not the bravest as he drew
near home. He invented many poor excuses
on the way—the busy times, the momentous
questions, peace or war—and Kleon had kept
him, requiring his counsel. He forgot them all
when he knocked at his own door with a forced
boldness. The porter opened; he entered with
assumed carelessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>All was silent. There was a scared look upon
the faces of the slaves—not a sound except the
splashing of the fountain as he crossed the courtyard.
He passed on to the inner rooms. The
ancestral sacred fire burnt upon the altar. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>one appeared. He reached his wife’s room. No
one was there.</p>

<p class='c010'>He searched the women’s rooms, and at last
found old Amykla, whose parents had been slaves
of Deinomaché, who had nurtured him in childhood
and watched over him through all his
boyhood; who would gladly have died for him,
and had received his wife with the same love
and devotion because she was his wife; who had
nursed her when his child was born, and tended
both with a mother’s care while he was away at
Delion. Amykla came with red eyes and unutterable
sorrow in her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Where is Hippareté? Quick, tell me—where
is Hippareté?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Hippareté is gone, Alkibiades! She would
stay no longer here.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘When did she go?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But yesterday. The poor lady waited for
two days and nights in tears. “Tell me, Amykla,
has he come?” she said each minute. “No,
Hippareté, not yet; he will come soon,” said
I to cheer her. “Tell me, Amykla, is he
hurt?” “Ah, no; we should soon hear if he
was hurt. The great affairs of Athens keep him.
He will soon be the greatest man in Athens. But
yesterday he went to sup with Kleon. Kleon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>can do nothing without him. They say Kleon
will have to go himself to conquer Brasidas, and
he wishes Alkibiades to go with him. He dare
not fight Brasidas without your Alkibiades.
But Alkibiades will not go. He will stay here to
lead the people, and protect his wife and child,
whom he loves so much.” So I babbled to
distract her thoughts, although I knew full well
where you were gone. “Bring me,” she said,
“the painting of him;” and I brought it, and
then, poor lady, she fell a-kissing of it, till I got
her to her bed and sat beside her as she sobbed
and wept. A troubled sleep came over her at
last, and in the morning a slave brought this
from Kallias.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He raised his head and read it.</p>

<div class='lh'>

<p class='c024'>‘“<span class='sc'>Hippareté</span>,</p>

<p class='c025'>‘“Alkibiades is with Timandra. I await
you here. He is not worthy of you. Come
to me and bring your child. I will protect
you.</p>
<div class='c026'>‘“<span class='sc'>Kallias.</span>”</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'>‘Ah, Alkibiades, could you have seen her
then! She rose indignant from her bed, and
taking the child, she bade me stay behind, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>dare to follow her. Then, turning to me, she
gave me the child again. She seemed as in a
daze, and went towards your rooms. When she
came back she threw herself upon her knees
beside her couch, and covering her head with
both her hands, she laid it on the pillow, and
there she wept until I thought her heart must
break.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And then she rose, walked slowly to the door,
and turning once more towards her couch, she
raised both hands to heaven, and then I think
she would have fallen had I not caught her in
my arms. She let me hold her for a little while,
but at the last she walked slowly away and
through the courtyard, bidding her women to
bring the child after her. So she left us,
Alkibiades.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Long time he stayed there in sadness; then
he rose and told Amykla she might go. Then
he gazed mournfully at all the small things that
were hers. He opened the great carved chest.
There lay her marriage robe, the long veil, the
faded wreath she had worn the day he brought
her to his home.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a strange swelling in his throat, such
as he had not felt for many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found a tablet with her writing on it about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>some small things that were wanted for Ephialtes,
their child—about a gift for him, as a surprise.
He remembered how happy she had been when
she gave it to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He almost wept as he went to lie down upon
the couch in his own room. He dare not lie on
hers; it seemed a profanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his own room everything had been put
in order. He could see her care for him, for
his things were just as he always liked them
to be.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found a scroll of writing on his table. He
opened it and read:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I have gone back to my old home. Would to
the gods that I had never left it!’</p>

<p class='c010'>He lay down and slept. It was late before he
woke. He remembered he had promised to sup
that night at the house of Polytion. He called
his slave and bade him prepare his bath, and then
anoint him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dressed in his finest robes, he went to Polytion’s.
The feast was nearly over, and the
guests heated with wine. They rallied him as he
came in. He heard Timandra’s name. He declined
all food, but drank eagerly of Polytion’s
generous wine unmixed with water. His wit
that night was more poignant, more satirical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>than it was wont to be. For all his efforts to
conceal his thoughts, it was plain that something
was amiss.</p>

<p class='c010'>Days passed by in the great solitary house.
His nights were spent in revelry. There was ever
present all the time a feeling of imperfectness,
a want. Sometimes he fought against it almost
successfully, then it would come over him again
when least expected. When he lay down alone
at night, or in the early morning, he thought of
all his wife’s great love and her devotion, and the
kindlier portion of his nature took possession of
him. This was the woman he was repaying for
her love by making her spend days and nights in
bitterest anguish. And all that time she was
wandering like a spectre in her brother’s house—the
brother she could never care much for, who
was ever trying to persuade her to leave her
husband altogether.</p>

<p class='c010'>There had never been any love between her
brother and her husband. She half suspected
his design was to get back the dowry her father
had given her, and the large patrimony he had
left her in his last testament. By the law of
Athens she knew if she left her husband she
and all her fortune would be in her brother’s
power.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>She soon got tired of living in the brother’s
house. Amykla sent her word each day how
unhappy her dear husband was. She pictured
him to herself alone in the big house, no one to
take care of him except Amykla and the slaves.
Poor old Amykla, she thought, could not do much
for him, or make up for her. Perhaps he was
wishing her to come back, too proud to ask her
to return. And, after all, his great offence, bad
as it was, was not a bit worse than many other
men had been guilty of. He was so strong, so
great, so noble. Perhaps she ought not to expect
from him all that other wives might properly
expect from their husbands, and he was pining
for her, longing for her back again. Was it not
her duty to go to him?</p>

<p class='c010'>Then for Ephialtes’ sake ought she not to go—forget
it all, try to know him better, please him
more, make him love her more than he could ever
really love that other woman? Ought she not to
put up with almost anything, rather than the child
should ever know his father had—had not been
always constant?</p>

<p class='c010'>Kallias was at her day by day about the
question of a divorce. He told her her husband’s
conduct had been such that she had only to go
before the Archon Eponymos, tell him her wrongs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>pray for justice, and, by the law of Athens, he
could not refuse it to her. But she must go
herself in person before the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c010'>She began to think of this, though with a
different design to that of poor, mean Kallias.
Yet how terrible to go before so high a judge
to accuse her husband, and lay bare the secrets
of their married life.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length she made a trembling resolution.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the last day of June, as Alkibiades was sitting
over his morning meal alone, full of many thoughts
and plans, and for the moment had almost forgotten
his domestic troubles, his friend Polytion,
rushing in, told him the news, already known by
half the town, that Hippareté was even now
in court before the Archon Eponymos suing
for——</p>

<p class='c010'>That was enough. Through the portico and down
the steps he went and swept along the
streets of Athens. The people stood aside to let
him pass, staring with wonder at his hurried
appearance, for he never stopped nor noticed
anyone till he had reached the Agora and the
Archon’s court.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a look of indignation on his face, he imperiously
brushed aside the crowd of loiterers
who thronged the building, and there before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Archon he saw Hippareté standing like a suppliant.
Two women supported her on either side, while
Kallias stood smiling near her.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the last moment her courage had forsaken
her; she could hardly speak a word. Had it
been an ordinary case the judge would have
grown impatient by this time. As it was the
daughter of Hipponikos, the wife of Alkibiades,
he listened patiently, and tried to help the
faltering lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>But before he could get her story from her
there was a loud disturbance in the building as
Alkibiades strode in, and, seizing his wife in both
his arms, as she stood trembling before the Archon,
bore her off in triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet she triumphed too. With womanly
insight, she had foreseen the probability of this;
and thus she triumphed.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we read the ancient story of this man’s
life, with all his faults and all his greatness; as
we assist, as it were, at the tournament perpetually
going on between the nobler aims and the
lower passions, between the loftier hopes and the
desire for immediate enjoyments, we view, from
this far distance, often with feelings of despair,
the worse part of him constantly thwarting, sometimes
spoiling, his highest efforts, his greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>victories. But in judging of his actions it is only
fair to recollect the manners of the times in
which he lived. We may condemn the morals
of that age, and those who try to imitate them
in our own; she could forgive him; let us not
pass too harsh a judgment upon him.</p>

    </div>

</div>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Many</span> great affairs of state have happened since
the events we have just recorded. Kleon, at
length carrying out the threat made at his celebrated
banquet the year before, put himself at
the head of the Athenian army, and at the end
of <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 422 met Brasidas, the Spartan general, at
the fatal battle of Amphipolis, and was defeated.
Both generals fell.</p>
<p class='c010'>The death of Kleon at that time was a leading fact
in the future life of Alkibiades. But for that event
happening just then, he might have been spared
his great temptations, saved from many errors,
and this narrative might never have been written.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nikias was left without a rival; his opponents
had no leader. His party, chiefly the safe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>wealthy citizens, with the suburban and rural
inhabitants, could now meet the Spartan Kings
and Ephors upon equal terms. A peace was
signed for fifty years. So far, perhaps, they
acted wisely. An alliance was then made, offensive
and defensive, between these two leading states—Sparta
pre-eminent again by land, the Athenians
by sea. A questionable policy, as the event soon
proved. So matters stood at the beginning of
the year 421, the turning-point in the career of
Alkibiades. The son of Kleinias then reached
the age at which all citizens of every rank could
take their part in the Parliament of Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some time he had been in much perplexity.
At one period he had nearly joined his fortunes
with the aristocracy, the peace party. Many
circumstances inclined him to that side. His
large domains were injured by the war. His
personal proclivities were all towards the knights
his comrades, and the great old families, most
of whom were his relations or his friends. Then
Nikias was getting old, and though an experienced
soldier, he was feeble, and near-sighted, and
bungling as a politician. Another and a younger
man would soon be wanted; none so likely to
succeed, or supersede, him as Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>By throwing in his lot with the old and powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>plutocracy, he would be spared the constant
efforts, distasteful and laborious, the oftentimes
degrading arts he knew were necessary, if he was
to win and keep the suffrages of an exacting
populace.</p>

<p class='c010'>The country and suburban interests were all
against the war. War meant loss and even ruin
to the farmers and workers in the mines, to all
who depended on their lands outside the city,
and to many of the middle class within. So
there was a strong party pledged to peace. He
was really persuaded, too, just now, that peace
with Sparta, if she could be made to keep her
promises, was better for the future welfare of
the state, surrounded by her many enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other hand, to join the oligarchs was to
desert the traditions of his ancestors. From
the reformer Kleisthenes, who had expelled the
tyrants—the far-sighted founder of the Athenian
democracy—to Perikles, his family had been the
leaders, the benefactors, of the people. The
policy of the old conservators seemed tame to
him. Changes must come. Better to lead the
van than drag along amongst the rear. Progressive
instincts of the people may be directed:
they cannot be confined for ever. The excitement
of the popular assembly was in accord with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>his impulsive nature. By force of intellect to
rule the people in the Ekklesia, as the deliberative
Parliament was called, as their recognised leader,
to sway them by his words, to persuade them by
his greater wisdom—was not that worth the
sacrifice of ease and high conservative respectability?
War, too, gave his ambitious soul more
scope than peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Kleon lived, it may be doubted to which
side the balance would have turned. Had he
lived but for a short time longer, it may be that
Alkibiades would have placed all his weight
against the war, have sided with the oligarchic
faction, have in time become their leader, have
lived and died a rich and comfortable conservative.
He might have been spared his great temptations,
his faults and sufferings, and might have missed
the tide which bore him on to victory, and enabled
him to make a name to be remembered amongst
the greatest of mankind for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Kleon died just at the nick of time, and
Alkibiades resolved, with all the ardour of his
energetic soul, to cast his lot upon the side of
progress and the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had already become famous for his lavish
hospitality. His triremes, when the state wanted
ships, were the largest, strongest, most completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>manned, and liberally provided. The chorus
which he presented to the city, when he undertook
the duty of choregos for his tribe, was the
finest, best instructed and most splendidly got up,
that had appeared upon the Athenian stage. He
had maintained the singers, both men and boys,
at his own house during their time of training,
and no objection had been made to his addition
of some of the famous musicians from other
Grecian cities.</p>

<p class='c010'>The play given on that occasion was that
most touching tale of Herakles and Deianira.
He arranged the choric songs himself, and gained
immense applause for that one especially, where
the chorus laments the tragic fate of the strong
man of Greece and of his wife. Though the
wits laughed and pretended to see in Deianira,
because of her jealousy, and her fears lest she
should not be able to retain the sole affection of
her hero, a resemblance to Hippareté, the people
were enraptured.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the chorus burst out, ‘But the Kyprian
goddess, silently busy, has plainly appeared the
doer of these things,’ the applause was unanimous.
Even the old-fashioned musicians who condemned
the new style in which the cadences of the songs
were sung, the larger instrumental accompaniment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and, above all things, the additional string which
his friend Timotheos had added to the kithara,
were for the moment carried away by the beauty
of the music, and forgot to grumble.</p>

<p class='c010'>His bounty to the poor, too, was boundless.
Even the lawlessness of which his enemies complained
had generally some kindness, or at least
some mere exuberance of spirits, at the bottom
of it. No instance could anyone remember where
his eccentricities had done harm to anyone.
These eccentricities were forgotten, forgiven, for
his generosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Passing one day when a state distribution of
small coins was being made to all the indigent
and workless, he ordered the dole to be doubled
at his charges. The people, unable to restrain
their gratitude at this new evidence of his compassion,
led him home in triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>And thus at the opening of his political life,
though there were envious rivals, he was the most
popular of the citizens. The people love to have
a man of great and ancient family to lead them.
So even before he could take part in the debates
of the Assembly he was recognised as the leader
of the people’s party in the place of Kleon.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a great event in a man’s life when he first
takes his seat in a popular assembly. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>many years of hope deferred and unsuccessful
efforts, when, each time we try, we think this
time at last we must succeed, and then, when the
votes are counted, after waiting with ill-concealed
anxiety for the result, we find we have again
just missed the mark, and we determine we will
never, never try again; when we think, after all,
the game is not worth playing, and we have to
make a speech thanking those who have voted
for us, and hinting at all we might have done
for our opponents, as well as for those who have
given us their support; and then, and then, come
other opportunities, and we allow ourselves to
be persuaded, against the grave advice of friends
and relatives, to try once more, and then, if at
length we are elected, with what strange indescribable
feelings we walk in and take our place, if
there is room for us, upon those seats it has cost
us so much to get at! Those only who have
undergone all this can really know the feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>True, Alkibiades had not to wait until he could
get the people’s vote and confidence as against
some other candidate, but he had waited for at
least ten years till he was old enough. Though
there was no precise law at Athens forbidding
citizens to speak as soon as they had completed
their twentieth year, the age at which they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>capable of assisting at the meetings of the Ekklesia,
there was so strong an unwritten custom against
anyone below the age of thirty presuming to
address the great Assembly that it had all the
force of law.</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, few ever spoke at all except the wealthy,
the high-born, or the trained orators. So great
was the critical nicety of the Athenian ear and
taste that any fault of grammar or pronunciation,
which all but the well-educated few could
not help but make, at once called forth a
clamour of disgust. It was only by force of
impudence, or extraordinary natural power, that
such men as Hyperbolos or Kleon could gain a
hearing.</p>

<p class='c010'>During all these tedious ten years he had felt
how much fitter he was to direct affairs, to persuade
the people, to govern in their name, than
those who were in power. He saw the short-sightedness,
and all the wretched bungling, both
in peace and war, of a man like Nikias. He saw
the mistakes and weakness of Kleon, and while
admiring the skill and artifice with which the
demagogue could gain his ends, he could not help
despising his—well, his want of breeding. Still,
for a whole year after the time when he might
have spoken, he only pondered over and elaborated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>his great designs, and thought or talked of them
in private; with marvellous restraint he held his
peace in public, and bided his time.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length the full time came. The day arrived
at last when he might not only sit and vote, but
might also mount the steps of the great stone
tribune, and loudly speak his long-pent-up
thoughts unto his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Argos, it was known, had been in treaty for
some time with Lakedaimôn for an alliance.
An alliance between these, the two strongest
states in the Peloponnesos, against Athens meant
the end of the Athenian Empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nikias had given back to Sparta the prisoners
Kleon had taken at Sphakteria, without receiving
any compensating advantage in return for them.
So the Athenians lost the great check they had
held for so long upon their rivals. Sparta had
promised, in return, to restore Amphipolis; but
this she had not done. She undertook, on oath,
to assist Athens in her wars; she gave her no
assistance in her efforts to recover her revolted
dependencies. She was bound by the terms of
the alliance not to make a treaty with anyone
without the consent of Athens; but she made a
treaty with Boiotia, the most dangerous enemy
of Athens, without consulting her.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>At last even Nikias and his party, who were
answerable for the peace, grew weary. Alkibiades,
who at one time had imagined, and hoped
for, the possibility of a peace with Sparta, the
home of many of his ancestors, and, indeed, had
endeavoured to bring it about, now saw the
hopelessness of ever being able to trust such a
people. He also foresaw the strength it would
bring to Athens, the perils it would save her
from, if her future policy were alliance with Argos
against Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>There never could be, he was convinced, a
lasting truce with Sparta. She was oligarchic
and dishonest. Argos was democratic, and he
had reason to know from his friends there that
the Argives, together with the people of Elis and
Mantineia, were about to send an embassy to
Athens to treat for an alliance. The Spartans,
hearing of this, and frightened by the warnings
and threats of their friend Nikias, thought it
was time they too should send ambassadors to
explain their conduct, and prevent, if possible,
the proposed alliance with the Argives and their
allies. Both embassies arrived at the same time
at Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Endios, a leading Lakedaimônian of high birth,
whom we shall meet again, was one of the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Spartan ambassadors. He was a relation and
firm friend of the family of Alkibiades, and was
his guest during his visit to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cordial terms upon which these two representatives
of both branches of the great family
remained with one another then, and always
afterwards, in spite of the strong part taken by
Alkibiades against Lakedaimôn, is a sufficient
refutation of the calumny on him, first formulated
by Thoukydides—who never can resist the temptation
of an opportunity to bear false witness
against the leader of a side opposed to him in
politics—that, with a cunning alien to his whole
character, he deliberately misled his guest and
relative by an unworthy trick, and induced the
Spartan ambassadors to deny their powers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only his friendship with Endios, but the
way in which he was afterwards received by
Sparta, is enough to dispose of the accusation,
without pointing out that the ambassadors would
have been below the ordinary level of human
beings in intelligence, instead of being picked
diplomatists, if they could have been taken in by
any such artifice as that ascribed to Alkibiades,
which would not have been noticed here had not
the tale of Thoukydides been repeated by nearly
every historian since he wrote.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The Spartan ambassadors appeared before the
Senate, and, amongst other things, declared they
had full powers to treat with Athens. They
were favourably received, and referred to a meeting
of the Assembly to be held in a few days, at
which the ambassadors of Argos and her allies
were also to appear.</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, the Spartan envoys had exaggerated
their powers before the Senate. They had really
only been sent to gain time, to prevent the
threatened alliance with the other Peloponnesian
states, not to bind Lakedaimôn by any precise
obligations. Having incautiously declared they
were entrusted with powers they did not in fact
possess, they now saw it would be necessary when
they came before the Ekklesia, the fundamental
ruler of Athens, to modify their unqualified pretence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The appointed day arrived. A summons to
the citizens to attend a meeting of the Ekklesia
to be held that day at the Pnyx was made by
criers throughout the town. A notice of the
questions to be discussed, of the business to be
done, was placed upon the well-known post in
the old Agora. At dawn the huge semicircular
theatre, cut out of the rock from which it took
its name, with its innumerable seats of stone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>was duly purified. Then came the heralds’ solemn
prayer, with the offering of incense, and the curse
on all who should give evil counsel or deceive the
people.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time the citizens had assembled, and
all, except the rich, received a token entitling
them to the payment of an obolos for their attendance.
They came in more than their ordinary
numbers this day, for the business was interesting
and important, and it was rumoured that Alkibiades
would speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people took their seats according to their
several tribes. The President of the Prytanes—those
whose duty it was, each successive month,
to guard in turn the sacred fire, symbol of a
common hearth of the one great family at Athens—called
on the business of the day, and then put the
ancient formal question: ‘Who wishes to speak?’</p>

<p class='c010'>The Spartans, as allies, had the right of prior
audience. They came forward and attempted to
explain their conduct. After making several
lame excuses, on being pressed, they admitted
they had not full powers to pledge their country
for the future.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Alkibiades arose, mounted the great stone
steps that led to the bema, or tribune, which
Solon and Aristeides, Themistokles and Perikles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>had often trod before—and which the traveller
may still see standing there silently, as they
stood more than two thousand years ago—and
found himself alone on that exalted platform,
about to engage the whole attention of the vast
audience.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the first utterance of his pent-up thoughts
his countenance glowed with animation. His
personality seemed to himself to be projected
on to the listening multitude. Almost unconscious
of his individuality, there was a consciousness
of a great silence round about him—a silence
of everything except his own voice, which sounded
as from a distance on his ears. He felt the rapt
attention of the crowd, and saw ten thousand
faces turned to him, their eyes fixed on him alone.
He marvelled for a moment at his rush of eloquence,
his facility of speech, his ready argument.
Yet it was altogether different to that which they
had been accustomed to from Kleon. There
was no ranting, no pacing up and down. He
had not studied in the schools of rhetoric in vain.
Even the lessons he had learnt among the Sophists
were of use to him. There was a conciseness, a conclusiveness,
in his arguments. His very hesitation
sometimes for a word, when he wished to be precise,
the repetition which he sometimes made of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>sentence ere he began another, which he sometimes
made, gave an added power to his utterance. But
there was something more than this—a soul
which spake from out the depths, and went to
the souls of his hearers, holding them captive.
His splendid presence, his graceful action, lent a
charm to all he said, and when roused to passion
his whole face seemed transformed, his eyes fired
with the latent energy within.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first he spoke of Nikias and the peace, and
showed how it had been dictated by a selfish
policy, because Nikias, having got a reputation
as a general, had nothing more to gain by war,
and was anxious to enjoy the laurels he had won,
for peace meant to him a long continuance of such
fame as he had got, free from all further risk,
while it prevented any other from rising up to
rival him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people rose, and, as it were, with one
voice demanded that Nikias should be haled
before the dikasts, the judges in such cases, and
tried for treason to the state. With perhaps
real generosity, Alkibiades soothed their vehemence.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘After all, it may have been the fault of old
age and imbecility, not of design,’ he said, and
then went on to say that others at one time—indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>he himself for a short space—had thought
that peace was necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>So, passing by the peace, he came to deal with
the alliance.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Alliance!’ he exclaimed, and with a state
known for its perfidy. Alliance! With a people
whose selfishness and craft made it better to have
them as open enemies than as friends! Alliance!
With a people who from the time when they had
laid upon themselves the most sacred obligations,
with all the solemn sanction of libations to the
gods, had never ceased to break each separate
clause and article of the treaty they then made;
and who quite lately, when they renewed their
promises, were, at that very time, intriguing with
the enemies of Athens!</p>

<p class='c010'>The Spartan prisoners taken by the great Kleon
at Sphakteria had by Nikias been given up to
Sparta, while Athens got nothing in return. Amphipolis,
which by another clause was to have been
immediately restored to Athens, was in the power
of the enemies of Athens still. All this was allowed
by Nikias. Panakton had been promised in like
way to be restored. It had been restored indeed,
but shorn of more than half its value, and dismantled
of its fortress. According to another
clause no alliance should be made by either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>party with the enemies of either, yet Sparta
had been allowed to enter into close alliance with
Boiotia, the deadly foe of Athens. All this
without remonstrance! And now the perfidious
Lakedaimônians were seeking fresh alliances with
Argos, Elis, and other states, to help them in
their old desire to crush Athens. All this he
had foreseen and provided for. The ambassadors
of Argos, Elis, and Mantineia were here ready to
come before the people and propose an enduring
treaty with them. He advised that the Spartans
be sent home again and the other ambassadors
be heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, he dwelt upon the greater wisdom
of a firm alliance with the democratic Argos—‘a
state with the same honest hopes and form
of government as we have, rather than with
an oligarchic aristocracy like Sparta, which hates
freedom and the power of the people; which
can do nothing that will bring us any good;
which will do all it can to aid our enemies at home
to restore an oligarchic rule’—and which would
in the end bring back that tyranny which his
own ancestor had once before freed Athens from,
they then had hoped for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people shouted their assent. They rose
and waved, shouted and cheered, and cheered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and waved again. They had most of them known
this Alkibiades from boyhood. They had laughed
at his many young excesses; sometimes they had
feared his lawless disposition, and dreaded his
imperious nature. They had been told by those
who knew him best that there was something
more within him. They had seen his splendour,
shared his generosity; but many doubted when
he had been chosen as their leader. But now
this—this was a revelation to them. None had
imagined the possibility of such great earnestness
and force in him who had been known
as the soft, sensual, luxurious, even effeminate
Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were for sending the Spartan envoys
home at once. Indeed, had it not been for the
sanctity of their office, they would have been
rudely treated. The ambassadors of Argos and
her allies were admitted to the Assembly, and
their offers listened to with respectful approbation.
No one could doubt which way the vote of the
Ekklesia would go.</p>

<p class='c010'>So great had been the effect wrought by the
speech of Alkibiades, that the more circumspect,
even among his own friends, taking advantage of
the rumour of an earthquake, thought it wiser to
close the session for that day, and not give their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>final vote till they had recovered from the spell
of the enchanter.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went home, declining the prayers of many
of his companions, of both parties, that he would
come to the gay banquets with which the rich
Greeks were wont to celebrate the closing of the
day. He was filled with many thoughts and
introspections. This was the end, so far, at
which he had aimed. He felt that thus far he
had done well. What of the future? Was his
choice always to be that which he knew was best
for Athens? He faithfully believed he had made
a wise choice that day. But in the future, when
her best interests might clash with his, when
hers and his might come in conflict,—what then?
He could see such conflicts possible. How would
he then demean himself?</p>

<p class='c010'>Amykla had heard the news; it had soon
reached his home. She had already told Hippareté
of his great success. A strange new feeling
came upon the wondering wife. She was not
surprised at what was told her. It was what
she always knew must happen if he cared to
try. She had loved him hitherto with a blind,
unreasoning love. She knelt before him now
as though he were a god.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> same year which saw his triumph as an
orator and a statesman gave Alkibiades an opportunity
of another triumph, in Grecian eyes, no
less great and wonderful. The first had brought
with it immense advantage to the state, and
repaired the injuries inflicted by the weakness
of poor Nikias; the second enabled him to do
perhaps as great a service to his country, and
shine resplendently before the whole of Greece.</p>
<p class='c010'>In the year 420 the ninetieth of the Olympic
games was celebrated. The war, which had
continued, with varying success, between Sparta
with her allies and Athens, shut the Athenians out
of Elis, the territory in which the Olympic games
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>were held. Athens had been excluded from the
two last contests. Argos and Elis, though neutral
in the war, were allied with Sparta, and dare not
act against her. This alliance was at an end.
Elis could now welcome the Athenians.</p>

<p class='c010'>They determined by the splendour of their
appearance to make up for their absence at the
two last festivals, and give the lie to the Spartans,
who were spreading it about that Athens was so
ruined by the ten years’ war that she would be
unable to make a show at the coming games.</p>

<p class='c010'>His patriotism and generosity, his love of splendour,
his foresight, his ambition, all determined
Alkibiades to make an occasion for display such
as no individual ever made before, and such as
no Greek has ever rivalled since.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plain itself where the Olympic games were
held had been designed, it seemed, by the gods
themselves only for this purpose. The vale
was sacred to the gods, the games were, as it
were, divine.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the four years which intervened between
each celebration the Olympic valley was tenanted
by its sixty temples, nearly three times as many
altars, and a thousand statues of former victors.
No human beings were allowed within that sacred
spot except the priests who tended the altars and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>ministered within the temples, which the gods,
as it was said, loved to inhabit. The scene
was fit for gods. The very air was more diaphanous,
serene, and clear, the rivers, the woods,
the hills, more lovely, than elsewhere; the flowers
there gave out a more delicious fragrance. All
was filled with a peace divine, and with the
beauty of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when the cycle of the months of quietude
was past, then all was animation, as striking
as the peace had been before. The Eleans,
special guardians of the sacred vale, had sent
their unarmed troops in preparation. Greeks
were hurrying hitherward from every colony,
island, city, town, from all the villages of Ionia
and Greece. The Spartans alone, on account
of their base conduct, were excluded. Stadia,
theatres, and places where the manly combats
of all sorts would be witnessed by unnumbered
crowds, were ready. Soon the surrounding hills
were covered by ten thousand tents and other temporary
habitations.  Where silence had reigned
so long, all became bustle and activity, until
the day came when the ‘architheori,’ who were
the chiefs selected to head the missions of envoys
(called ‘theori’) sent by the different states to
represent them at the sacred games, were seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>approaching the renowned Olympic valley, with
all their followers, high and low, musicians,
singers, runners, wrestlers, boxers, and athletes
of every kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Unless we realize the depth of the religious
meaning of the games we shall but inadequately
understand the honours that were given to the
victors. After due study of the history of the
Grecian race, we say advisedly that no honour
known in Greece, whether that given to the statesman,
the poet, sculptor, tragedian, or even to the
greatest warrior and general, was to be compared
with the honours given to the victors at these
games.</p>

<p class='c010'>A statue of each victor was erected there; and
the people of his native town or village went
forth to meet him as he returned, and brought
him home in triumph, with garlands, music, and
with incense. An opening was made in the city
walls, that he might come in by a way no one had
entered through before. His name was graven on
stone or brass in the most noted place, and he
and his descendants after him were maintained
at the sole charges of the state. No Roman
Emperor, proceeding in triumph through the
streets of Rome, was more honoured than a
victor at the Olympic games.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>And the reason was the holy sanction given
them. It might be of the last importance to
the several states that their young men should
be for ever training themselves, keeping their
bodies in subjection, strengthening their thews,
their muscles, and their nerves, so that at each
returning festival they might maintain the glory
of their native towns or villages, and prepare
themselves to fight when called on for their
liberties. That was, indeed, a great thing, and
had an influence on every man and boy, and
woman too, within them. But the first thought
that ran through all was to do honour to the
gods, who in their various temples deigned to be
present and accept the services and sacrifices
that were offered to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>And this, the ninetieth Olympiad, was for
many reasons peculiarly grand. First came the
Korinthian theori, with their four-horse chariot,
destined to run in the chief race, with their chanters
and musicians, as well as their athletes, in magnificent
array. Ere they had been received by the
presiding priest and his attendant train, the smaller
company that had come from the island of Chios
was seen descending from the north-east of the
Olympic hill, which protected that side of the
natural amphitheatre. Lesbos came next, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Kyzikos from the distant Propontis. And then
processions from all the different Ionian and
Doric Grecian towns, from all except from Sparta.
Each was distinguished by its own style of dress,
which differed in some respects from that of
the others; each with its athletes and its chorus;
most of them with their racing chariots.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they were all assembled, some began
to sneer at Athens, saying that after all her
boasting they doubted if she would appear at all,
being too proud to make a humble show, too
impoverished to make a great one. When all
were welcoming friends long unmet, kinsmen, and
old acquaintances, and there was a general
feeling of expectancy, a stir arose among them,
a consciousness of something coming, and over
the highest road appeared the foreguard of the
architheorus of Athens. He was drawn superbly
in his equipage of state. Then followed the
renowned athletes, the well-known champions
with the diskos, the wrestlers, boxers, runners,
whose names were known as household words
in all the Grecian cities. Then came the four-horse
chariot of the state, which also would
contend in the great chariot race, the crowning
contest of the sports.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the Athenians’ stately show came on. Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>who had jeered were silent; all saw that Athens
meant to do her best, and would, an she could,
still show herself the first of all. But then appeared
a wondrous thing—another chariot with
four bays, driven by Tolas, the famous charioteer,
now in the service of Alkibiades, and surrounded
by his retainers.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was soon noised abroad that this fine chariot
and its more splendid horses, bred by Alkibiades
himself, and reared on his patrimonial estates, was
sent by him to strive to wrest the first prize from
all states and peoples who should contend. Seldom,
it was said, had any private individual yet been
known to send a four-horse chariot. Though cities
and states and kings and tyrants might do so,
it was considered too great a burden for one
man so to uphold the honour of his land, and
thus do service to Olympic gods.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the people had recovered from their
astonishment, and to the amazement of them
all, there followed close behind another chariot,
driven by another of Alkibiades’ men, and then
another, and then two more, all four-horse chariots
belonging to him. And before their fresh wonder
was abated, lo another four-horse chariot, and then
another. This last one, more ornate and graceful,
designed for show rather than for the rough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>contest of the race, was driven by its lord himself.
The four magnificent black steeds, scarcely less
fleet than those of the first chariot, knew well his
voice and face, but best of all the firmness of
the hand that guided them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cheers, the shouts of admiration, the joy
of all the people, as he passed along, proved how
the honour he had done to them, to the games,
and to the gods, was recognised by everyone. The
theori of various cities vied with one another in
their welcome. The Ephesians asked to be allowed
to offer him a sumptuous tent, in which he might
repose; Chios, that it might provide the forage
for such horses; the Lesbians, that they might
supply his wine and his repasts; while the theori
of Kyzikos sent him the victims for his holy
sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day began with prayers, libations, solemn
processions, and sacrifices to the gods; for the
gods themselves had not disdained of old to
strive for prizes at these games. Then came
gymnastic exercises. The first prize was won
by Klynios of Korinth. Then a race for youths
wont to do all their exercises nude, and in the
open air, not shivering and coy, as unaccustomed
to the light and fresh air of the heavens, but as
if in their native element, unclad.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Then a chariot race, won by the state of Argos.
Two chariots of Alkibiades took part in this;
one came in fourth. Then many contests of
leaping, boxing, wrestling, and then a chariot
race, won by the Boiotian chariot. This was a
most exciting race, and would have been won
by Alkibiades, as most men said, but that the
Syrakusan competitor went too near the altar of
Taraxippos, dreaded of all horses, and steeds,
chariot, and charioteer were commingled in the
dust, in front of the Athenian car, just as its
driver prepared to make his final rush; so it
obtained only the second prize.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first day’s sport concluded with music and
selections from the ‘Ajax’ and ‘Agamemnon’ at
the larger theatre. Alkibiades was loudly cheered
as he came in with the missions of Thebes and
of Athens. And after that came a brilliant
feast, at which the Eleans entertained the
representatives of the various states and all who
had come to try for prizes at the games.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the second day a race for hoplites, heavy-armed
soldiers, with nothing on but their shining
greaves and helmets and carrying their shields,
opened the proceedings. Then a chariot race, won
apparently by the Boiotian federation—at least, in
their name the chariot had been entered, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>a Boiotian victory it was proclaimed. But then
a curious scene occurred. A rich and well-known
Lakedaimonian named Laches, who was allowed
to be present as a private person, but was
not permitted to take part in the contests,
because of the conduct of his countrymen, unable
to restrain his pride, rushed forward eagerly and
placed a wreath upon the head of the victorious
charioteer, an act which implied that he, and
not Boiotia, was the real owner of the chariot.
The people were indignant at the trick by which
the Spartan attempted to outwit them and to set
the order of the sacred games at nought. The
Elean guardians of the course, seizing the offender,
punished his act of disobedience by scourging
him, and drove him from the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the third day, after many other races,
came the pentathlon, in which the victor had to
excel in the fivefold exercise of running, jumping,
wrestling, and throwing the spear and the diskos.
The name of him who won the prize for these
combined accomplishments has not come down
to us. Then, last of all, came the greatest of the
races, in which the four-horse chariots of different
states—Korinth, Miletos, Chios, Samos, Argos,
Lesbos, Athens, Abydos—took part, and also the
private chariot of Alkibiades. The Thebans, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>had won on the first day, prayed that they might
be suffered to contend again in this the crowning
struggle. They were especially pledged, if possible,
to beat their rival Athens; and, indeed,
as the end proved, they did excel the architheoric
chariot. By consent of all the judges Thebes was
allowed to race, although already victors at these
games.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whatever attention had been given to the
various events by those who cared especially for
this or that peculiar form of emulation, it was all
concentrated now on the closing contest. Some
thought they could trace signs of anxiety on the
face of Alkibiades, as he assisted Tolas to mount
the lightly-built, well-balanced vehicle, and could
catch almost a pathetic look as he stroked the
manes of those dear horses who knew his touch,
and neighed with equine love as they turned their
heads and saw their master, giving promise that,
come who might against them, they would do
what in them lay to bring him glory and repay
the care he had bestowed upon them. How
many times in after-years he thought of those
so cherished animals, their more than human
fidelity!</p>

<p class='c010'>But now it was time to take his place among
the great men and hide all traces of emotion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>It was for this moment he had longed so many
years, of this he had so often dreamt by night,
to this, when a boy, he had looked forward
as the great effort of his life—his worthiest
effort. Now it was here—the very moment was
arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was speaking courteously to those near him—men
whose names would live in their various
cities for generations not yet born; but he
saw them indistinctly, or as in a dream. His
thoughts, his eyes, were there where ten chariots
stood abreast and forty horses were waiting for
the signal to be given, their hearts leaping with
excitement, feeling as though wings had come upon
them and they must fly. And off they went;
the cries were deafening. Seas of faces watched
them upon their way; seas of faces greeted them
as they turned the corner and the first round
was run. ‘Thebes and Boiotia!’ cried the crowd,
as the victor of the first day’s race was seen to
lead. ‘Thebes and Boiotia!’ yelled the Thebans,
and all who took their side. Thebes and Boiotia
seemed, indeed, to be about to gain the double
prize.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here they come round for the last time, and
the trumpets sound a gallant flourish. Now
they near the end. Thebes and Boiotia first—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>much ahead of Tolas there, just behind,
as calm as his master tries to be—now scarcely
ahead at all. ‘Ye gods, a hundred victims
if I win!’ And as he stretched forth head and
neck, forgetting his affected carelessness, among
the mass of faces gazing all one way, peering to
catch the first sight of the flying chariots, the
horses straining every nerve and sinew of their
frames, he met the great eyes of Sokrates turned
full upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some had come to sell their wares: painters
to puff their pictures; sculptors to show their
graven images; authors to recite their works, if
they could get a chance; most had come to watch
the games and races. Sokrates had come to
watch mankind, and amongst them one he cared
for more than all the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was no time now to notice Sokrates. The
chariots were scarce three hundred yards to
where the winning-post was waiting for them,
when, as with a bound into the air, the four bay
horses brought their car up to and right ahead
of all the others, and shouts arose: ‘Boiotia’s
beaten! Tolas comes in more than two chariot-lengths
ahead! Athens and Alkibiades!’</p>

<p class='c010'>He heard no more distinctly. The hills went
round for a moment, a mist came over them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>he felt his hands grasped by many a rough and
horny palm, and then he heard an endless shouting
in his ears, and he felt somewhat ashamed as
he wiped away a few big drops that had started
from his forehead, and one or two others that
had gathered to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before them all he was crowned with the
simplest wreath on earth, made of wild olive-leaves,
but the wild olive-tree from which they
had been gathered grew only in that sacred
grove, and the wreath was worth more to him
and every other Greek than any kingly diadem.
There was a great feast given by the architheori
that night to the several victors in the games;
and first among them, calm and radiant, sat the
Athenian conqueror.</p>

<p class='c010'>When it was over and he had retired to the
tent provided for him by the state of Ephesos,
and his servants and companions had left him,
seeking their various amusements or repose, he
strolled forth disguised, to muse in quiet after the
day’s excitement. The scene was a curious one,
the plain and its surrounding hills glimmering with
ten thousand lights, and far and near resounding
with music, mirth, and revelry; yet he heard
and saw but little. While deep in a dreamy
state of happiness, and some half-conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>sense of being still unsatisfied, a well-remembered
voice recalled him to himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Son of Kleinias, art thou now content?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why not, Sokrates?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Does the prize which thou hast won, that
barren wreath of olive, satisfy thy soul?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What could on earth, if that did not?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Thou seest these thousands of the Greeks of
every state and city except one, all engaged in
peaceful rivalry and games, and in the service
of the gods; would it not be well if Greece could
ever be at peace, and all the cities and peoples
live together, like one state?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed, I think it might be well.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And hadst thou not an opportunity of late
to keep peace with the bravest of them all—the
rough and manly Spartans?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I know not what you mean, Sokrates. I
did the best I could for Athens. But tell me,
thou who art so fond of questioning, when
first the gods made man, did not they put
into his heart a love of war? And if we
should have peace for ever, might not mankind,
grown sleek and fat, perchance forget the
gods, nor ask for courage, nor delight in manly
exercise?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Not so, oh son of Kleinias, for peace would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>nourish wisdom, and so bring out all that is
virtuous in man.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But war also gives many opportunities of acquiring
wisdom and practising virtue, and let me
ask you this, Sokrates, have not the great gods
planted in man’s breast a strong wish to propagate
his race, and if there were no wars, would
not the earth be overrun with men, till they
must starve or feed on one another? Is it not
better that we, being men, should die in noble
combat, like the heroes who have gone before
us, than feed like wild beasts upon our fellows?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Son of Kleinias, thou hast put too long a
question. I cannot answer it. The gods alone
know which is better, peace or war.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after this conversation Alkibiades assisted
at the ratification of the Argive treaty. It had
been stipulated that this should be done at these
Olympic games. So before the temple of Olympic
Zeus, where the great gold and ivory statue of
the god, the masterpiece of Pheidias, had lately
been erected, he and the other leading men and
generals on both sides swore, with libations to the
god, to observe it faithfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he gave his splendid banquet to the
Elean chiefs, to the various missions which had
come from all parts of Greece, and to the victors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>in the different games. Next day he set out for
home; and the people from the isles and colonies,
and all the states of Greece, departed, and the
Olympic vale became once more the quiet habitation
only of the gods and their attendants.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went back much in the same array as that
in which he came, but with an added glory. He
had come as a competitor, he returned a victor.
Seated in his chariot, dressed in purple, the wild
olive wreath upon his head, he entered Athens.
If he had been a god, indeed, descending from
Olympos, he could hardly have been more rapturously
received. The city in one mass came
out to meet him. Flowers were strewn along
the way; with songs and incense he was greeted.
Friends and foes alike strove who could give him
warmest welcome. None could keep at home
on such a day. The people were seized with a
joyful madness, like a troop of Bacchanals.</p>

<p class='c010'>Afterwards, when enthusiasm had quieted, as
all enthusiasms will in time, Pyromachos, the
sculptor, was ordered by the city to design that
wonderful bronze statue of Alkibiades, which
represents him in a life-like attitude, himself
driving the four-horse chariot with those noble
animals by whose aid he won the chief prize at
the ninetieth of the Olympic celebrations.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> battle of Mantineia was fought, as all men
know, in the month of June, 418 years before
the Christian era; and, as all men do not know,
Alkibiades saw it fought.</p>
<p class='c010'>In 419, a year after what was the crowning
glory of his early life, and perhaps its zenith,
he was chosen as one of the strategi, who were
ministers of state and generals of the Athenian
army.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before he could receive that dignity, one of the
highest in Athens, and before, indeed, he could
have been made one of the mission at the Olympic
games, he, like everyone else elected to either of
those offices, was called upon to show that there
was no stain upon his public or his private
character. This is an answer to those enemies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of his who charge his earlier years with acts of
serious lawlessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his capacity of general, with a picked force
of men, he had been sent across the Peloponnesos,
more for the sake of encouraging allies than to
engage an enemy. He visited Argos, and there
the prop and stay of Argos, the author of the
treaty with them, and the victor at the recent
games, was hailed by almost all as a hero and
a deliverer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The treaty strengthened and enlarged, he went
to Patrai, on the west coast, taking with him a
contingent from Argos, not so much to increase
his force as to show how real was the alliance
between Athens and the Argives. A glance at
the map of Greece will show how useful Patrai
would become to Athens in her struggle with
Peloponnesian enemies. He convinced the citizens
that if the city were fortified by long walls
stretching to the sea, they might defend themselves
against any enemy by land, while Athens
would be able to bring them aid by sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mission finished, he returned to Athens.
Soon it was known that the Lakedaimonians were
on the march for Argos. He was immediately
placed at the head of a larger force than he had
before commanded, and sent to Argos; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>enemy retired, so, after harrying some of the
Lakedaimonian allies, he went back to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his return, enraged at this fresh proof of
Spartan perfidy—for they were still allies of
Athens, and bound by their treaty not to make
war upon Athenian allies—he so roused the people
in the Ekklesia that they decreed there should
be written at the bottom of the brass pillar,
where the treaty between them and Sparta was
engraved, these shameful words for Sparta:
‘The Spartans broke their oaths.’</p>

<p class='c010'>After this, in March, 418, without further warning,
the Spartans equipped a large force of all
kinds under King Agis against Argos, and marched
upon its territory. The Argives met them. There
was no time to get help from Athens. Some of
the higher families in Argos, like the aristocracy
in Athens, favoured Sparta and an oligarchic
government. By their influence a truce for four
months was concluded with King Agis. Then
the Athenians, seeing there was something weak
in Argos, sent Alkibiades as ambassador there,
to help the democratic party to keep up against
their Spartan enemies without and their traitorous
aristocracy within the city walls. They also sent
a force of horse and foot to aid them, under
Laches and Nikostratos. The people of Argos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>were at first afraid to break the truce which had
been made against their will with Sparta. It
required all the eloquence of Alkibiades in their
Assembly to prevent them sending back this
help from Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke to them of what, in times gone by,
they had endured at Sparta’s hands; how Sparta
was still as great an enemy to them as ever;
how ‘two years ago they had made that solemn
pact with Athens; how well the Athenians had
kept it on their side; how it had been ratified at
the ninetieth of the Olympic celebrations.’ There
were shouts of applause as he thus modestly
referred to the scene of his late victory. Warmed
by this token of their favour, he concluded:
‘Oh men of Argos, while we are here to go with
you to death or victory, while we are sworn
never to leave you till you have overcome this
treacherous foe, will you go back from your
promises, and leave a name to after-times like
that of Sparta, as breakers of your word and
faith, and of a treaty of alliance ratified before
the whole of Greece, and at the very dwelling-place
of Zeus?’</p>

<p class='c010'>He had almost as great a success in the Assembly
at Argos as he had when he first proposed
the treaty with them at Athens. The people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>decreed with acclamation that the war with Sparta
should go on; the truce was at an end. They
at once proceeded to lay siege to Orchomenos, in
Arkadia, to the north of Mantineia. They took
it, and then marched on towards the oligarchic
Tegea, a firm ally of Sparta. The Spartans, too,
marched towards Tegea, and took up their
position near the temple of Herakles, and began
plundering the Mantineian country. The Argives
and Athenians, together with the Arkadians from
Mantineia, met them in the low country near
Mantineia. The Argive force took up a strong
position on the steep side of Mount Artemision,
where it would be difficult to attack them, and
whence they might with advantage descend upon
the Spartans in the plain below.</p>

<p class='c010'>King Agis saw that to assail the allies upon this
vantage-ground would be to court defeat, and
yet he must do something. There were ugly
rumours about him in the camp, as well as at
Sparta. He was threatened with a prosecution.
It was said against him that the truce he had
made was in itself an act of treason, that he had
the Argives in his power then, and had spared
them for some purpose of his own, and had, by
letting them go, enabled them to get help from
Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>However, for all that they might say of him,
he was firm, and led his army away till he came
to a stream on the boundaries of Tegea and
Mantineia, about which the inhabitants of those
places were continually quarrelling. On to whichever
territory it might be turned, it would do
considerable damage. Agis began to divert this
stream on to the land of Mantineia, thinking that
this would bring the Mantineians, and perhaps
the whole Argive force, down from their place of
vantage to stop the flow of water.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upon the other side there were murmurs too.
‘Are we to stay here like pigeons in a rock for
ever? See how the Spartans leave their ground!
Will you let them escape us now as you did before?
It seems to us there must be treason amongst
our generals. Are they not of the aristocrats, and
oligarchs in secret? For aught we know they may
be in correspondence with the oligarchs of Sparta.’
The Argive generals were weak and frightened,
and knew not how to act. They had no doubt as
to the tactics of the Spartan king, and yet they
dare not keep their army waiting in its present
mood. If Alkibiades had but been there, his firm
command would soon have made itself respected,
as it will be seen in this story to have often done.
He could do anything with the Argive people, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>had greater faith in him than in their own generals.
But he was away in Argos acting as ambassador,
and had no authority to interfere in the military
operations, or the future course of Greek affairs
in this portion of Arkadia might have gone
differently for Athens and for Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>So on that night in June the Argive force, with
their allies, descended from their strong position,
whence they could defy the enemy, and bivouacked
upon the plain, ready next day to meet or to
pursue him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The enemy soon returned in marching order,
and took up their former post by the temple of
Herakles, determined, if their strategy had not
succeeded, to try to take the Argive position by
assault. The strategy, they found, had succeeded
but too well, and, as they descended the
Tegean defile, they discovered their opponents,
drawn up in full array, in the open plain before
them. To change from column into line was
with the well-drilled Spartans the work only of
minutes, and their adroitness called forth admiration
from Alkibiades, who, unable to get up to
them, was watching from a distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>He saw the Mantineians posted on the right,
with a body of Argives and Arkadians in the
centre, while on the left were the Athenian foot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and his own comrades of the cavalry. He saw
the Argives advance in haste and fury, and the
Spartans slowly to the music of their pipers,
which kept them in step together and in perfect
order. He saw the Mantineians charge the left
wing of the Spartans grandly, and break their
line, and follow them, as they retreated, to their
waggons. He saw with anguish the Spartan
king dealing out destruction on the Athenians
and the others of the Argive force, and about to
overwhelm them, when, to his astonishment and
delight, Agis drew off his men and hastened to
assist his left wing, which was being harassed
by the Mantineians as it retreated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now was the time for the Athenian horsemen
to charge the Spartans in the rear; now his
own cavalry might outflank the king; but there
they stood motionless, demoralized. Both their
leaders, Laches—his old friend Laches—and the
other general, were slain. There was no one to
encourage them, no one to lead them, none who
was capable of rising to the great occasion, and
they slunk unworthily away.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mantineians and the remainder of the
Argive host, seeing themselves abandoned, retreated
in good order into Argos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus Alkibiades, in vexation and despair, saw,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>for a time, his best-laid plans and hopes frustrated.
The Spartans claimed, and rightly claimed, a
victory. By this battle they recovered their renown
as the first military power in Greece, which
they had lost at Sphakteria, and their success
threw discredit on the new Argo-Athenian alliance.</p>

<p class='c010'>What Alkibiades had foreseen and feared soon
took place. The oligarchic faction, which sided
with Sparta against Athens, had been growing
strong in Argos for some time. The Spartan success
at Mantineia enabled these oligarchs to effect a
peace with their Lakedaimonian friends. Alkibiades
was forced to go back to Athens. The
Spartans showed their gratitude to their friends
within the walls of Argos by sending them a
thousand soldiers to assist them. This enabled
the Argive aristocracy to overthrow the democratic
government and establish an oligarchy
in its place, which managed to keep itself in
power for some months—months which were
marked by atrocious acts of cruelty and outrage.</p>

<p class='c010'>This sort of government, established and maintained
in such a way, upon the ruins of a popular
control, seldom lasts for long. The means by
which it seems to keep itself in existence generally
put an end to it by at length rousing the suffering
victims to such a state of rage that they become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>willing to risk all in their efforts to shake off the
incubus.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people of Argos, driven to despair, rose
and drove out the tyrants, slaying a few of them
by way of warning to the others. On the news
of this rising reaching Athens, Alkibiades was
sent there again to help the people. He persuaded
them, as he had persuaded the citizens at Patrai, to
build walls from the city to the sea. So great was
his energy and his determination that this should
be done without delay that he sent for a small
army of masons, carpenters, and workmen of
all kinds from Athens to assist, while he himself
took part, encouraging by his words and presence
the whole population, freemen and slaves, women
and children, in the work. The walls had hardly
been completed, and he had only just returned to
Athens, when the wisdom of his advice was proved.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the summer of 416 the oligarchs were found
to be at their intrigues again, inside and out of
Argos, and so dangerous did they become that
he had to be sent for in haste from Athens, not
merely as ambassador this time, but in full power
as strategos, in command of twenty ships of war.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a proud moment for him as he sailed
with his fine warships into the port, where the
walls, which he had caused to be built, stretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>right up to Argos. He was obliged to take
strong measures against the intestine enemies
of the State. Three hundred of them he carried
off and placed, disabled from doing further mischief,
in various islands dependent upon Athens.
And thus, as far as he was able, did he nullify, or
at least minimize, the advantage Sparta gained
at Mantineia.</p>

<p class='c010'>And all this time that he was thus vigorously
aiding his country and her allies by his wise
counsel and his strong actions he was leading at
home a life of splendour and pleasure quite unparalleled.
No one was so courted as he—the
model of all excellence for young men to imitate.
His dress, his manners, his extravagance, his
eccentricities, were the talk of everyone, and
many were the deeds set down to him that he
was never guilty of. The witty sayings, which
only the choicer spirits could appreciate, were
passed about amongst them; while his great
orations at the Ekklesia, in spite of a slight lisp,
which seemed to sit not ungracefully on him,
moved the people to such a pitch of admiration
that they would often escort him home in triumph
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor was he great in words alone. No general
of troops was so active as he; no one more patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>or practical in the supervision of the forces of
the states; no one wiser or clearer-sighted in the
council of the leaders. Nikias and the chief men
on the other side ever sought his advice in serious
difficulty. Nor could anyone be found to represent
their country in an embassy where courage and
prudence were required so well as Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>The office of the strategi was a great and
important one. It combined the functions of a
Minister of War and of Foreign Affairs as well
as those of a Minister of the Interior, besides
including the active executive work of general
and admiral, and the management of all the
forces. Alkibiades discharged the arduous duties
of his office with zeal and efficiency. But, his
work over, there was a buoyancy about him
which rebounded from restraint; then he threw
off all cares, and, underneath a high ambition,
he showed an eagerness for sport and love of
amusement. After a day of toil, when it was his
wisdom and advice which had determined the
policy of Athens, he could not keep his boyish
spirits down, or hide a sly contemptuousness of
his fellow-men and their formalities.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus this man of indomitable courage and
energy, of infinite resources and ambition, the
man to whom statesmen at home looked for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>guidance, because of his greater foresight of that
which was to be, and foreign states for help because
of his influence and power,—this man, the first
in Athens, the man whom all men knew and most
loved and admired,—might be seen, his serious
day’s work done, running through the streets
like any schoolboy on a holiday, crowned with
violets and ivy, followed by a joyous band and
the mad music of the oboe and the double flageolet.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was, indeed, and in spite of all, the best-loved
man in Athens. There was good reason
for it. Besides what he had done in public for
the people against their natural enemies, ever on
the look-out for opportunities to get the better
of them, there were numberless poor folk whose
pains and sufferings, wants and miseries, his
generosity and kindness had solaced and relieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such pre-eminence above other men cannot
exist in this world without engendering envious
serpents. Given a man of more than ordinary
parts, of luck or fortune, and we are sure to find
detractors, and delators, too, as we are equally
sure to find some evil mixed with good in almost
everything. And by so much as the hero is the
greater than other men, you are the more sure, if
you look deep enough, to find some faults. If he
has more of human nature in him than the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>run of ordinary men, the greater will the certainty
become that faults will be discovered,
and anxiously laid hold of, too, by those who
know not how to imitate his virtues.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at the end of this year 416, on his return
from Argos, that the snakes first raised their
heads and hissed. His greater opponents could
not help admiring him: they were too generous
to attack him secretly. It was one of the democracy
who struck the first blow at Alkibiades.
A poor potter named Hyperbolos, a maker of
earthen lamps, the butt of Aristophanes, who,
on the death of Kleon, had thought he ought
to be chosen leader of the people, was put
forward as the tool of others.</p>

<p class='c010'>The secret remedy of ostracism had been invented
as a last resource if ever the influence of
any individual threatened to make his power
greater than was becoming for a citizen in the
democracy. This instrument had not been used
except against the greatest men. When it was
to be put in force no name was mentioned
publicly; only a proposition was moved that it
should be put to the vote whether some one
should be banished. In private conversation the
promoters of the scheme canvassed their friends,
and pointed out to them who it was that, in their
opinion, ought to go.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Upon this occasion Hyperbolos used all the
power of his small malignity to hit his hated and
successful rival. There was considerable risk
that a majority of votes, making up the necessary
number, would be given against the inoffensive
Nikias. But Alkibiades, too, was in
some danger. He had naturally the oligarchic
faction against him, besides a considerable portion
of the country party; and the railing tongue
of the democratic traitor stirred up the sterner
democrats by talking of his mad caprices, his
extravagance, his high birth, his wealth, even
his popularity, as reasons why his presence was
dangerous to the state.</p>

<p class='c010'>With consummate skill the object of this
secret blow turned it aside and made it fall upon
his enemy. He arranged with Nikias that none
of their friends whom they could influence should
vote against either of them, but that they should
all write the name of Hyperbolos upon the piece
of pottery by which the vote was given. So it
happened that poor Hyperbolos was banished.
When the people saw that this two-edged sword
had smitten the man who tried to wield it, and
that so formidable a weapon had struck so mean
an object, it was felt to be dishonoured, and was
never used again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>We</span> must now take the reader away from Greece,
and ask him to turn his thoughts for a little while
to Sicily. If an example were wanted of the
effect of intestine quarrel, we need only point to
Sicily at the time at which our story has arrived.
That land, so fertile and so beautiful that a Holy
Roman Emperor, who knew both countries,
once irreverently declared that the Almighty
would not have chosen Palestine for His peculiar
people if He had first seen Sicily,—this island,
which, more than any other, gives us a vision
of those happy isles to which the heroes of
the past were said to go,—this beautiful island,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>like many another fair spot on earth, was torn
by its dissensions.</p>
<p class='c010'>There were the Siculi, the early, if not the
original, inhabitants, and some small Phœnikian
settlements, besides colonies from Ionian and
Dorian Greece. Syrakuse, originally a colony
from Korinth, became the leading city, and being
so, began to dominate the others, and especially
to trouble those which had been founded by the
other portion of the Grecian race. Early in the
Peloponnesian War the people of Leontini, to the
north of Syrakuse, who were of Ionic origin, had
called upon the Athenians for aid. For no reason
apparently but the lust of plunder the Syrakusans
had despoiled their city. The Leontines
were old allies of Athens, and she was bound in
honour to do all she could in their support. At
that time all she could do was not much. But in
the year 427 Laches was sent with a squadron of
twenty ships, and he and his successors in command
succeeded in reducing the power of Syrakuse
so far that a peace was made, which left
the Leontines and other peoples, whose liberties
had been in like manner threatened, independent
of their more powerful neighbour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenians having retired, and the usual
contest breaking out between democrats and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>oligarchs within the walls of Leontini more fiercely
than before, the Syrakusans took advantage of the
opportunity, and finally laid waste the city and
drove the citizens into exile. The Leontines again
appealed to Athens, but for some time without
success. Athens was then too much taken up
with her own immediate enemies. But although
it had long been felt by the more patriotic of the
Athenians, by all those who felt strongly for the
honour of their country, that a wrong was being
suffered by their old allies and kinsmen in Sicily
at the hands of the descendants of their Korinthian
rivals, it was some time before any practical
steps could be taken to comply with the prayer of
the outcasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, in 416, a deputation from Egesta, an
ancient colony said to have been founded by
Philoktetes in the North-West of Sicily, which
had made a treaty of alliance with Laches ten
years before, came to seek assistance. They
poured out the story of the wrongs they were
suffering from the people of Selinous before the
Senate and the Ekklesia, appealed to the treaty
that had been made with them by Laches, and
declared, if they were not aided soon, these enemies
of theirs and the Syrakusans would crush them
utterly, as the Syrakusans had crushed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Leontines, and would become together masters of
the whole of Sicily.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were seconded in their prayers by the
exiles from Leontini, who were still in Athens,
and who had never ceased to urge their petition
for redress on the Athenians. The Egestæans not
only asked for help, but undertook to help themselves,
and promised to defray a large part of
whatever expense their allies might be put to
in assisting them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenians before deciding sent ambassadors
to Egesta to find out whether their suppliants
were able to do, in their own defence,
what their envoys had promised. The ambassadors
returned to Athens early in April, 415, and
assured the people of the wealth of Sicily in
general, and particularly of the city of Egesta.</p>

<p class='c010'>Athens again was up in arms. This time it
was not to repel invasion of the Spartans, or to
assist allies in the Peloponnesos; it was to decide
upon an armed voyage of discovery to a land of
fabulous resources. Of those resources they could
form some notion from that which the ambassadors
reported they had seen at Egesta. ‘Why,
even in that remote town the temples shone with
gold, with silver shrines and precious vessels.’
The ambassadors, and even the sailors, were served
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>at every banquet on plates of gold and silver
wonderfully wrought. They told how, on leaving
Egesta, ingots of fine silver had been put on
board their trireme—here the ingots were borne
into the Ekklesia—of value to maintain a fleet
of sixty triremes for a month. And in that
month what might not be done? Something like
the wild enthusiasm which led the English in
Elizabethan times to sail for Eldorado seized on
the Athenians. Little was heard in the gymnasia
but the glory of this quest; and the old men
talked of the wealth and the material support
which the conquest of Sicily would bring them
in their contest with hostile Grecian states, and
of the advantage of Syrakuse as a strategic base,
whence, at will, they could issue forth to spread
their empire in Italy, in Africa, in all the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never had enterprise been supported by more
general consent; and from the first Alkibiades
had been the life and soul of it. But just before
this time a silent grief, such as he had never known
before, had fallen upon him, and for a time had
checked his ardour. Not that it had blinded him
to the advantages which the undertaking might,
if well carried out, bring to Athens, or stayed
his efforts for his country’s good; but it had
sobered him, it was so new to him. It made him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>pause and wonder if the objects of his high ambition,
when obtained, and the fulfilment of his hopes,
when realized, would be worth so very much.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his return from Argos, somewhat saddened
by the failure of his treaty with that state through
the defeat at Mantineia, he had found more happiness
in the quiet converse with his wife than he
had felt before. He was getting older; some of
the pleasures of his earlier years had lost their
interest. She, too, needed consolation. Ephialtes,
their first-born, their only child, had died while
her husband was away at Argos. On his return
she clung to him with a stronger love than ever.
He was touched by the tenderness, the forbearance,
she had shown to him in his wanderings, his
frolics, his dissipation. He felt now, come what
might from enemies rising up around him, and
whether all his hopes were realized or not, there
was one at home to comfort him and receive him
as a hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>This short time that he could give to her was
certainly the calmest, perhaps not the least happy,
he had throughout the remnant of his troubled
life. But he could not stay long with her. His
private affairs obliged him to go off to Ephesos
at the opening of the spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his newly-built and wonderfully-constructed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>trireme, the <i>Eros</i>, the most sumptuous ship yet
built for any Greek, with its great eyes peering
from the bows, and the image of the boy-god,
from whom it took its name, carved cunningly
upon the stern, with the bows and arrows of that
deity wrought among wreaths and festoons of
roses all along the sides, he sailed for Ephesos.</p>

<p class='c010'>A fair wind filled the purple sails, which had
figures of the god of love worked in silver on
them, and bore him like a conqueror to the port
of Ephesos. And like a conqueror the Ephesians
received the greatest man of Athens, the victor
at the pan-Hellenic games. He forgot the rebuff
his hopes had met at Mantineia while he spent his
pleasant time in that splendid town, and having
done his business there, in like manner he returned
to Athens. His friend Polytion was looking out
for him. He put off to meet the <i>Eros</i> as soon as
the well-known purple sails were seen approaching
in the east.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was an effort of cheerfulness about
Polytion as he came on board.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet no—yes, there was no doubt something
was wrong.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What is it, man? Speak! say at once! No
good trying to hide it. Quick! Tell me, is all
well?’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>‘No, Alkibiades, all is not well. Your
wife——’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Not dead, ye gods? Not dead?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, Alkibiades, and she has left a son.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The purple sails had fallen as they neared the
harbour. He would have fallen, too, but his friend
caught him, and held him for a time. This friend,
the riotous companion of so many bouts and
frolics, this careless dog, good for a night’s convivial
merriment, was overcome at the sight of
such grief as he had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades went home in silence. He desired
to be alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amykla met him at the door. Cries of grief
came to him across the courtyard, where the
fountain splashed as ever, the white peacocks,
his especial pride, sunning themselves around its
basin, and the notes of lamentation sounded
through the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>The women were about her room mourning
and crying their wailing ‘Aiai!’ of lament. He
sternly put them out.</p>

<p class='c010'>There he stayed alone with her he had left, so
short a time before, full of love and fond caresses,
and hopes that she would soon bring him a son
to bear his name and carry on the noblest house
in Greece for ever. There she lay, pale and still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>with a faint smile upon her face, as though
knowing she had done her duty, though she had
died in doing it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We fear we have dwelt too long over this mere
private matter, and kept the reader waiting for
Sicilian affairs, which are, indeed, important, and
the turning-point in the history of Athens. For
some time he mourned as he thought of his past
life—the neglect, more than neglect, with which
he had so often treated her; the suffering she
had endured in silence; her gentleness, devotion,
and forgiveness—but he kept his grief shut up
within him. It was his business to direct his
countrymen, and never was there such an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c010'>An Assembly was held towards the end of April,
to consider finally the Sicilian question. The
people were almost unanimous for a warlike
expedition. Few dare say anything against it.
Nikias, fearful and doubting as usual, whispered
his fears. His supporters were afraid to run
counter to the people. They dreaded lest their
hesitation might be put down to cowardice, or to
a mean desire to escape the burden of furnishing
their proper portion of the fleet. Everybody
expected Nikias would oppose whatever Alkibiades
proposed, so they paid the less attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>to his sad forebodings, as they raised their voices
in approbation of the motion that sixty triremes
should be at once got ready. Then they elected
the generals. Nikias, Lamachos, and Alkibiades
were chosen.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the first time he had been elected to
such high duties. Before this, as strategos, he
had been twice sent with a small force into
the Peloponnesos, once with twenty triremes to
the relief of Argos. He had often gone on
embassies, but hitherto he had been thought too
young to share the command of such an armament
as this.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another Assembly was summoned to meet in
a few days, to pass measures for the due equipment
of the fleet, and to provide the necessary
funds, so that whatever the newly-appointed
generals might ask for should be at their disposal.
This Assembly was even more crowded than the
first, and all were silent when Nikias appeared
before them in the Tribune.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people expected the demands about to be
made upon them would be large; they were
prepared to meet them. To everyone’s astonishment
Nikias began his speech, not by encouraging
them to put all their hearts into the work they had
decided to undertake, and to give those to whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>care they had entrusted the Athenian future a
liberal support, but by an urgent protest against
the expedition altogether. He entreated them,
with tears in his eyes and tears in his voice,
to reconsider their decision and recall their
vote.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was a course unprecedented in the annals
of the state, and against an express law, which
made it penal to reopen a matter which had been
discussed, and upon which a vote had been already
given. He admitted this. It was a proof of the
respect in which they held his character that
they heard him patiently. It was a signal proof
of the dignity with which they clothed their
debates in the national Assembly that they
listened to him without interruption.</p>

<p class='c010'>He used the well-known arguments against the
dangers of a war, and especially one so far away
from home, and dwelt upon the greater wisdom
of strengthening the empire that they had already
than of seeking to extend it.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I have no selfish motive in objecting to the
war. War has ever been my field of honour.
By that won I my distinctions. My whole life
is a proof that I fear not for myself—I fear only
for my country and its worthy citizens. Those
I consider to be worthy citizens who know how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>first to value their own estate and protect it
from ruinous expenditure.’ Then turning towards
his young fellow-general: ‘If anyone,
elated by being but just now made a strategos
of an enormously important expedition, before
a fitting age has given him due experience
and wisdom, would urge you onward to this
fatal enterprise, it is because he thinks to shine
in all the pomp of war and make a show with his
fine equipage and prancing horses, and turn the
dignity of general into a fit occasion—ye gods!
a fit occasion—to indulge his luxury and grandeur.
Oh, men of Athens, let not such a one imperil
the safety—nay, the very existence—of us all that
he may make himself conspicuous. Remember,
there are citizens who could not only dissipate
their private fortunes upon fine studs of horses
and such-like frivolities, but afterwards make
shipwreck of the state. I tremble when I see
a band of rash young men before me, sitting
close together, near their leader, and I exhort
the older men not to be frightened from their
opposition to this crazy work by fear of hearing
the epithet of cowards applied to them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>No other would have dared to speak at that
time in such a way of the leader and favourite
of the people, or thus to oppose the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>desire. The people not only let him speak, but
allowed the whole question of the expedition to be
reopened. Several spoke in favour of the war, a
few against it. At length Alkibiades ascended
the tribune. He felt the speech of Nikias had
made an impression upon many. Not only was
the war he had so much at heart, together with
his generalship, at stake; a personal attack, as
everybody knew, had been made upon him. It
had been suggested that he was ruining his
patrimony. This was, indeed, a serious charge,
for, were it proved, it would, by the law of
Athens, disable him from holding any public
office.</p>

<p class='c010'>He began by answering, in perfect taste, the
attack of Nikias. He apologized for speaking
of himself at all. He regretted, he said, that he
had been forced to do so by the ungenerous treatment
he had met with at the hands of his brother-general,
his elder colleague.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘As to my prodigality and the prancing steeds
you have just now heard so much about, for whose
honour and at whose expense were those horses
bred and taken to the pan-Hellenic meeting? If
I did spend something of my patrimonial estate
in rearing them, was it not for Athens that I did
it? And if with them I won the greatest prize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>in Greece, it was that you, not I alone, might
reap the glory. I only bore the charges. And if
I have many times equipped great triremes for
the state at larger cost than some other citizens
are wont to undertake, was it not for Athens
that I did it? If I have put finer choruses
upon the stage, and furnished forth my public
functions with greater splendour, it was that you
and strangers from all over Greece might see and
hear them, and that they might bring the greater
praise, not to myself, but to my country.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘If you have shown me honour now in choosing
me strategos, and the colleague of such a well-known
general as Nikias, it is not for any merit
of my own, but for the glory reflected on me by
my ancestors. You have not forgotten all my great-grandfather
Kleisthenes did for the democracy of
Athens when he expelled the tyrants and oligarchs,
and’ (turning to Nikias) ‘all who favoured them;
nor have you forgotten my grandfather Alkibiades;
nor my dear father Kleinias, who taught me by his
life and actions to spare nothing of my own in
your defence, who lived for the people, who died
for Athens. Why need I speak of Perikles, my
cousin and my tutor, whose memory is fresh in
the minds of every one of you? It is as the scion
of such a steadfast race that ye have honoured
me, not for myself; and may the gods grant that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>in this expedition I prove worthy of that race
and of your choice.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He went on to speak of the envy small minds
feel at another’s rise. He touched on what,
during his comparatively short career, he had
been able to accomplish—the league of the
Peloponnesian states against their chief enemy,
the strengthening of the ports of Patrai and
Argos.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘If in my youth, and even at the very height
of those great follies you have just now heard
about, I have been able to do somewhat for the
state, what may I not do, when opportunity
presents itself, in the time of my maturer, my
more sober years? At any rate, you have joined
with me one of whom none can say that he is
likely to offend by too great temerity.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He then answered the taunt of Nikias as to
his youth, and the mischievous attempt of his
colleague to stir up the old against the young.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Above all things, never let this wicked policy
of setting old and young at variance turn you
from your purpose. But, as in the good old
days our forefathers, old and young together, by
their united counsels and their united efforts,
brought Athens to its present greatness, so do
you now endeavour to make her prosper.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Then he went through the various questions
practically. He showed how many of the Greek
colonies in Sicily, even the Dorian colonies, would
come over to them on their first success. He
ridiculed the exaggerated report of the strength
of Syrakuse by sea and land, and laughed at the
fears Nikias had confessed that the Spartans
might take advantage of the absence of the
Athenian fleet.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why, we shall leave behind us a larger fleet
than that of all the other Grecian people put
together.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he appealed to the generosity of his
hearers, and to their love of honourable dealing,
not to break the oath of allegiance they had
sworn to weaker states, who were relying on them
and praying for their aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘How have we made this empire of ours, which
all men wonder at, but by assisting our allies,
whether Grecian or barbarian, when called upon?
If now, when our aid is sought, we stay at home
in idle negligence, we shall but stay to see that
empire crumbling bit by bit away. Not thus did
our great ancestors build up the state. They
anticipated attacks and stopped them. They
waited not for them to come.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This oration, which we can but so imperfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>turn from its strong original into our modern
tongue, electrified the people. There was no
longer any doubt about the expedition. Even
Nikias professed himself convinced. Yet he
played an unworthy part. He attempted, by
a weak device, to accomplish that by trick which
he had failed to do by argument.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nikias spoke again, and demanded exorbitant
preparations of men, ships, and commissariat,
hoping by this means to damp the ardour of those
who would have to provide these things. It had
the contrary effect. Demokrates exposed the
artifice, and called on the strategos to declare in
precise terms what and how much he wanted.
The people ratified their vote, gave Nikias all
he asked for—more than was necessary—and left
it to the generals to judge what force they thought
would be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through this underhand and unsuccessful
scheme Nikias struck the first blow against the
fortune of the Sicilian expedition. In attempting
to stop it he made it assume a greater size
than was originally intended. As in the case of
the invading force of Xerxes against Greece, its
unwieldy proportions became an element of
weakness.</p>

      <div class='line in14'>‘Each by each was thought</div>

</div>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> fleet was to have been ready to sail by the
beginning of the following June. In the meantime
each Athenian tried to outdo his neighbour
in his eagerness to make the undertaking glorious.
The citizens, whether bound to serve or not,
pressed in to be enrolled as soldiers. The rich
men emulated one another in the strength and
size of the great ships they offered. Ambassadors
were sent to all allies demanding aid for the
important conquest—aid in men, in money, and
provisions. The generals were allowed a free
hand in their expenditure.</p>
<p class='c010'>By the time appointed everything was ready,
but by an unfortunate coincidence the date fixed
for the departure of the fleet fell on the Adônia,
the days when the Athenian women kept their
yearly mourning for the lamentable death of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>beautiful youth, beloved of Aphrodite, and then
celebrated their rejoicing at the glad festival of his
happy resurrection. Clearly the fleet must not
put to sea at such a time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other unforeseen delays postponed the sailing
till the first of August. Before that day arrived
a horrid and unspeakable event occurred at
Athens. The religious custom of the time had
placed in every street a stone image of the divine
champion Hermes, and a rough statue of this
god, so dearly loved and reverently worshipped,
stood at all the cross-roads, before every temple,
and many of the private houses. These images
were more than sacred: they were objects of
peculiar devotion, for Hermes was not only
messenger of Zeus, he was protector of the state
and Constitution. To do offence to him was to
offend the state, and tempt the potent deity to
desert the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some days before the fleet was to have sailed,
when everyone was up and about betimes, and
full of eager preparation, it was discovered by
someone who had gone first abroad that one
and then another of these statues had been
shamefully cut and disfigured. Dismayed and
horrified, those who first heard of it spread the
dreadful news about the town. Then, by degrees,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the fact was realized that not one or two, but
almost every image of the god before the temples
and the houses, as well as at the cross-roads, had
been treated in the same disgraceful, sacrilegious
manner, and in many instances reduced to a mere
shapeless block of stone.</p>

<p class='c010'>To understand the great horror of the people,
we must recollect how religious feeling in a Greek
permeated his whole being, lived in his life, his
thoughts, his actions, and, as it were, controlled
him; how it was closely bound up with the
state political; how he believed that the gods
were incorporated with the city; how the deity,
too, was almost identical, and embodied with his
statue. To do reverence to the statue was to
reverence the god; the reverse had never been
conceived as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>Astonishment was soon turned to indignation.
Rumour ran wild. The timid, the more religious,
the superstitious, feared the wrath of Heaven, the
destruction of the state. Others saw in it the
work of traitors in their midst. It was the work
of secret emissaries of Syrakuse, or of Korinth,
the parent country of the Syrakusan colony. Or
it was a party of the citizens, too cowardly to
oppose openly the Sicilian expedition, who had
thus attempted to turn men’s thoughts away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>from the great enterprise; or perhaps it was a
deep-seated plan of the ever-suspected oligarchs
to overthrow the democratic Constitution. All
were, at any rate, agreed that, whoever the sacrilegious
culprits were, their punishment should be
exemplary, so that the anger of the gods might
be averted and the honour of the city vindicated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Senate immediately met and appointed
three citizens, whom they called ‘searchers,’ to
sift the matter to the bottom, and report to the
Assembly. The perpetrators of the outrage, it
was evident, must be very numerous. It was
impossible that a few conspirators could, in one
short summer’s night, have worked this havoc
on hundreds of the cherished effigies. Rewards
were offered, and other inducements were held
out to all men of whatever rank, even to slaves,
to give any information which might lead to the
discovery of participators in the abomination.
Even pardon was assured to an accomplice who
should inform against his co-conspirators.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the midst of this religious zeal and fury a
meeting of the Ekklesia was summoned to give
its last instructions to the generals. For a time,
while the concluding counsels were being taken,
and the plan of the campaign settled,—and it
was being arranged how, after succouring Egesta
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>against its enemies, the people of Leontini should
be restored, and how, when Syrakuse had been
taken, its inhabitants should be sold as slaves,—the
cloud which had hung over Athens for the
last few days was almost dissipated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Assembly was about to separate, having
given full powers to their trusted generals to act,
in all contingencies, as it might seem best to them
for the good of Athens and her allies, when
Pythonikos mounted the Tribune and demanded
silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Athenians,’ cried he, ‘one of the men to
whom you have given the care of this great
armament, a general to whom you have confided
the safety of your soldiers, your sailors, your
ships, and perhaps the future of the State, is a
profaner of the mysteries of Eleusis. I am here
by my witnesses to prove it; do to me as to you
seems good if I fail to establish this accusation.’</p>

<p class='c010'>On minds already strung to the highest pitch
by that other dire undiscovered sacrilege this
charge fell like a thunderbolt. The Ekklesia was
paralyzed, and sat in stupid silence. Pythonikos
continued:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I will call before you one Andromachos, a
slave, who, being himself uninitiated, will tell
you how he saw the mysteries profaned, and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>his oath before the gods declare it was Alkibiades
himself who did it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The slave was called, but before he gave his
evidence all who had not been initiated were
ordered by the President to leave the Ekklesia,
lest they might hear what it was not lawful for
them to know about the holy mysteries. Andromachos
related to those who stayed, scarce knowing
what they listened to, in their horror and
astonishment, all he pretended to have seen and
heard—how, being in the house of Polytion, he
had seen Alkibiades and Miletos and Nikiakles
burlesque and parody the sacred rites.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades rose in indignation, denounced the
charge as a conspiracy of certain oligarchs and of
his personal enemies to deprive him of the command
with which the people had invested him,
and declared the base charge had been kept back
till the last moment in order that he might not
have an opportunity of meeting it before he sailed.
He called upon them to judge him then and
there, and not only to deprive him of his command,
but decree that death he well deserved
if this accusation should be proved against him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His open adversaries, as well as his secret
enemies, were frightened by his boldness. They
knew his power with the people, who were more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>than ever devoted to him since the part he had
taken in the Sicilian campaign. Those who were
ordered out of the Assembly before Andromachos
gave his evidence carried the news of the horrible
charge into the city. It rang through the town.
The Argive and the Mantineian contingents that
had come to fight for Athens said it was mainly
for their love of Alkibiades they had been induced
to come, and if any wrong were done to
him they would go back again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people vowed vengeance upon his enemies.
The excitement rose. Their zeal against the
Syrakusans was for a moment turned against
Pythonikos and his associates. Pythonikos knew
this, and the impossibility of hitting the object
of his hatred while he was there in Athens. So
he prayed that the further hearing of his charges
might be postponed for the present.</p>

<p class='c010'>No one could say of him that he had not made
them in the presence of the accused. ‘Let him
go forth,’ he said, with assumed generosity—‘let
him go forth and lead the fleet, and when he
returns, as we all hope, triumphantly, he shall
present himself before the proper judges, and be
tried according to the law.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades saw through the scheme.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No,’ said he; ‘let me not go on such a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>and arduous enterprise with a charge like this
hanging over me, filling my thoughts, embittering
my days, weakening my arm while I am fighting
for you. This, indeed, were too unjust. If
guilty, I am not worthy to go; if innocent, ought
I to bear so great a punishment?’</p>

<p class='c010'>His prayer prevailed not. The people would
on no account allow the conquest of Sicily to be
put off. Without knowing it, they drove their
ablest citizen, their strongest bulwark, from them,
placed him in the power of unscrupulous
assailants, drove him into the arms of their
inveterate enemies, and took the first step
towards their own destruction.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> day after the meeting of the Assembly
which has just been described saw another, and a
very different, scene enacted in the streets and
ports of Athens. The great fleet was just about
to sail. At dawn the accused general rode at the
head of the departing troops from the city to
Peiræus. Alkibiades rode on his good horse
Ephialtes, the horse his first-born son had loved,
and which had been called after him.</p>
<p class='c010'>He had bidden a long farewell to the old paternal
mansion, when Amykla brought the infant Alkibiades,
that his father might embrace him ere
he left. But this was no time for sentiment.
He was about to do, to be, that which he had
desired to do and be ever since he was a boy
playing with his schoolmates in the very streets
he was now to march through proudly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>These streets were lined with the thronging
populace as the troops marched by. Multitudes
followed them upon the way. All who had
brothers, sons, beloved ones, among them followed.
When they reached the port, there lay
the big warships decked out magnificently. The
impatient Lamachos had already been on board
his vessel for some time, chafing at the delay,
caring little for the doings at the Ekklesia. All
he cared for was to be at Syrakuse, fighting the
Syrakusans. As for Nikias, he had stolen down
the night before, not sure of the reception the
populace might give him after the conduct of
Pythonikos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Flowers decked the great triremes from prow
to stern, silver goblets glittered on the higher
decks. All was jollity as the hoplites, the archers,
and the other light-armed soldiers, and a small
force of cavalry, marched on board the transport
ships. They were not long in embarkation.
Then the trumpets sounded, and the whole
army stood upon the decks, Alkibiades upon the
stern-deck of his <i>Eros</i>, the finest trireme of them
all, built and furnished at his own expense.</p>

<p class='c010'>The heralds prayed the gods, and especially
Poseidôn and the god of war, and Pallas, to be
propitious to them, favouring their arms. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>every one of the soldiers, even the humblest
marine, poured forth libations. This was a scene
never to be forgotten by the vast crowd who saw
it, as every soldier poured out libations from silver
cups, the higher officers from golden vessels, to
the gods.</p>

<p class='c010'>The multitudes upon the quays joined in the
prayers, and echoed back the sacred hymns and
pæans boasting of success, when the rowers took
their places, and when to the time chanted by
their leader, with rhythmic oar they struck the old
Aigaian waters. And the great ships one by one
filed out of the Peiræus.</p>

<p class='c010'>The August sun shone on the brazen shields
and breast-plates, and was reflected on the spears
and swords of that strong host, which thus left
Athens splendidly. How many of them, ships or
men, were ever again to see the much-loved city?
Loud cries of confidence and farewell, echoing
along the shore, followed them upon their way,
and then the sailors, warriors, and Alkibiades
saw last of all the great Akropolis and the statue
of Athene.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was with an exulting heart that, standing on
the stern, he caught the last sight of that fair city.
But had he a prescient foresight even now of the
years which must pass over him and Athens, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>all he was about to suffer, of the sins against her
he was to commit, before he should next time
look upon the virgin goddess and her holy temple?
Perhaps it might be such prophetic vision, or
perchance only the result of the pain he had
suffered, the indignation he had felt, or a natural
reaction after the excitement of the long day’s
work—the greatest day, perhaps, but one of all
his troubled life—certain it was he felt unsatisfied
and almost gloomy. There seemed to be something
floating between him and victory as he
stood there—something coming and going between
him and his future fame. He was half
inclined to believe it was a guide, a monitor, a
daimôn, such as Sokrates had told him of, that
was warning him, but with a voice so indistinct
he could scarcely understand it, telling him he
was entering upon a path that would lead him far
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>His sensitive and nervous nature—for with all
his readiness and boldness he was sensitive and
nervous—had recoiled before the charges brought
against him. Perhaps this accounted for his
feeling. His intelligence penetrated the designs
of insidious enemies, capable of any secret crime
against him, or against the state, so they might
gratify their hate. He believed—and history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>has supported him in his belief—that the outrage
upon unoffending statues of a beneficent god was
the clumsy act of a band of unknown enemies,
who thought, in some vague way, they might
fix the crime on him; that, failing in that scheme,
some of them had then, by a more artful and
dangerous plan, suborned a slave, and instructed
him to make a specific charge against him when
he was on the eve of leaving Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his secret soul he feared their machinations
while he was away, with no one at home to stamp
the poison out, as he could have done had he been
there. His soul revolted from the injustice of it
all; and as he stood out to sea, his highest hopes
apparently attained, one of the commanders
of the grandest expedition Athens had ever
ventured on the waves, there was a melancholy,
a feeling of unrest, of aspirations even now unsatisfied.
And when the night fell, and the lights
grew indistinct along the coast, as he turned him
in to sleep he sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fleet arrived prosperously at Korkyra.
The land forces were more than doubled by Ionians
and Korkyræans and others they found waiting
for them there, all eager to take a part in the
great invasion. Thirty-six triremes were added
to the fleet. One hundred and thirty-six ships
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of all sorts rode proudly in the harbour when
the three generals reviewed their troops. Everything
was ready for a descent upon Sicily.
The fleet was divided into three divisions,
under the three commanders, and all set out for
Italy.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Rhegion the generals combined their forces
and held a council. Nikias was of opinion they
should sail to Selinous, force the inhabitants to
do right to the Egestæans, make a demonstration
before the chief Sicilian cities, victual the fleet,
and return to Athens. Lamachos was for a very
different course—sail straight for Syrakuse, land
the troops hard by, destroy the forts, force the
harbour, and while the fleet was attacking it by
sea, march the troops upon the town and take it
before it could recover from its surprise or put
itself into a fit state of defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades showed foresight as well as courage.
He discerned the motives of the mean-souled
Nikias, as well as the danger of his impulsive
colleague’s plan. Nikias had opposed the enterprise
from the beginning, and had prophesied its
failure. He was now doing worse, for he was
advocating a course which would make his prophecy
come true, and had urged the adoption
of that course with all his energy. Alkibiades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>wanted to be able to point to the effect of
following his rival’s counsel.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What!’ said he, ‘take this vast fleet back
again, that has cost the Athenians and their
allies so much—take it back before we have
done anything but make a vain show before
the ports of Sicily! I should be ashamed to
face my fellow-citizens. Besides, you must remember
more than half our force is not Athenian;
it has been furnished by allies. What will <i>they</i>
say who have readily brought with us their contingents
to rescue their friends and colonies from
the clutches of the Syrakusans and the other
domineering cities? My advice is to discover
what trusty friends we have in Sicily, and endeavour
to make others, so as to get a sure basis
in the island, before delivering our main attack
upon the front of the offending.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It is the part of a prudent general not to land
his forces in an unknown country before he has
discovered what the resources of the country are
and what is the strength of the city he is going
to assault, lest, if he should happen not to meet
with complete success at first, he might find it
difficult to feed his men, or to make a good
retreat if that were necessary.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Were it not for these unforeseen but possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>dangers, I should agree with our colleague Lamachos.
But, on the whole, therefore, my proposal
is that we first gain the goodwill of Messana,
the nearest port, or, failing that, the goodwill
of some other town, whence we can descend
with both army and fleet on Syrakuse, after
we have made our observations of the strong
and weak points of that important city.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Lamachos at once came round to this opinion,
as every one else must have done who had any
wisdom or any experience of practical warfare,
or any knowledge of the port they were about to
attack. He was a fine leader, was Lamachos,
when a dash at the head of troops was wanted,
but without prudence or firmness of conviction.
The superior wisdom of his more gifted colleague,
which was before long to mark him out as one of
the greatest generals of any age, soon convinced
him. Nikias then grudgingly gave way. His
attitude was not one to inspire confidence in
minds less hopeful than those of his two colleagues.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades started at once for Messana in the
<i>Eros</i>. No troops were allowed to enter the town.
He went alone into the Assembly. But his fame
had gone before him. He addressed the citizens,
pressing them to join the Athenians and their
allies, and pointing out the advantages they would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>gain by the help of such a force as he had brought
from Greece.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people were divided. Some were for joining
the Athenians, others feared the fury of
Syrakuse when the Greeks had gone away. The
more wary answered they could not open their
gates to an armed force on either side, but that
the Athenians might, if they would, encamp in
their territory away from the town, and buy
what provisions they wanted at a reasonable rate.
This was something gained. Alkibiades was not
discouraged. He thanked the people, and before
he left he managed to gain over a party amongst
them, who engaged to open the gates to him
whenever he should give the signal.</p>

<p class='c010'>He hastened back to Rhegion, and with a
portion of the fleet sailed south to Naxos,
where he was cordially received, and obtained
promise of help. He went on to Katané. There
he was refused admission, and thinking it unwise
to begin hostilities with the small force
he had, or to make certain enemies of those
who might be won by management, he went
on towards Syrakuse.</p>

<p class='c010'>There he met his colleague Lamachos cruising
near the harbour, longing to be inside it. The
two generals with their conjoined force went back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to Katané, taking a Syrakusan vessel by the way.
On reaching Katané, they received permission to
enter the town without troops. They ventured
to address an assembly of the citizens. While
Alkibiades was endeavouring to persuade them
to join the Athenian alliance, a party of Athenian
soldiers who had landed secretly from the ships
forced one of the city gates that had been
left unguarded, and suddenly appeared in the
assembly while Alkibiades was speaking. The
Syrakusan party amongst the citizens fled; the
rest, without waiting for further arguments,
voted for the Athenian alliance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades then made a reconnaissance of
Syrakuse alone by sea, and landed with a body
of two hundred heavy-armed men nearly two
miles north of the town. He came upon an outpost
on the high ground guarded by a small body
of Syrakusan soldiers, whom he easily overcame,
and captured a store of arms and provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been able to form a good idea of the
strength of the greater and the smaller port against
an invading fleet; he now saw the weak point of
the defences on the land side. But, as he was
making his observations, he did not notice that
a body of cavalry had left the town by the north-western
gate, and had come round the rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>ground immediately behind him, while a force
of some three or four hundred light-armed troops
were threatening him upon the left flank.</p>

<p class='c010'>He thus found himself cut off from his ships.
To retreat before the cavalry was impossible,
while to stand there to receive a charge on one
side by the infantry, and in the rear by the cavalry,
was to await certain death or capture.</p>

<p class='c010'>A strong wind which had rendered the landing
difficult, and made the anchorage of the ships
precarious, was blowing from the south as these
horsemen rode down from the high ground to
the spot where Alkibiades and his men now stood
at bay, prepared to receive the charge and to
die like men.</p>

<p class='c010'>High tufts of long grass, which had been dried
by the September heat, grew on all sides of them.
The wind bent the long yellow blades as it swept
over them. To set light to this inflammable
growth was the inspiration of a leader who was
seldom at a loss in the greatest extremities.
The fire rose at once. The wind increased its
fury. It caught the stunted olive-trees and under-growth,
as it surged onward full in the face of the
Syrakusan cavalry. The horses reared and plunged,
and turned and fled in disorder as the flames
came on and the smoke half smothered them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Nor were the light-armed troops much better
off. For Alkibiades ordered his men to charge.
They had the advantage of a slight declivity, and
so the heavy-armed Athenians emerged, as it were,
from out the fire and smoke, and marching through
the light-armed Syrakusans, cut them to pieces
as they went, and reached their ships in safety.
Alkibiades returned straightway to Katané.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he sailed away, like another Ulysses defying
Polyphemos, he had some cause to feel satisfied
with what he had accomplished. He had just
escaped from what at one time looked like a very
serious predicament, and in spite of a timorous,
procrastinating colleague on one side, and a
rash, unthinking enthusiast upon the other, he
had done good work for Athens and her allies.
He had arranged to get a footing in Messana
whenever he thought it expedient to land troops
there. Naxos was entirely with him. He had
established a base of operations against Syrakuse
at Katané, where the greater part of the fleet
now lay.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was something to have done in the short
time he had been in Sicilian waters. He had
done much more than this: he had discovered a
point of attack on Syrakuse, and though it might
require some sacrifice of ships and men, he saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>that, in its present state of defence, this chief port
and town of Sicily would be theirs without much
difficulty, if attacked at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such were his hopes as he returned, well satisfied,
to Katané. The clouds which had been
hanging over him since he left home lifted and
almost disappeared. His high spirits rose again
as he thought of his entry as a conqueror into
Athens, bringing with him the spoils of a mighty
city, and offering to his countrymen the gratitude
of a people delivered from oppression, and the
sovereignty of Syrakuse, and of the whole of
Sicily, all to be laid at his country’s feet.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<div class='lh'>

<p class='c027'>‘It would give me pain to tell you of the rumours that are
flying about among the people, and the number of discordant
and inconsistent opinions held about me.’—<span class='sc'>Boethius.</span></p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>As</span> Alkibiades entered the harbour of Katané, he
was surprised to see a well-known ship there,
which certainly had not come with the rest—no
less a vessel than the sacred state trireme of
Athens, the <i>Salaminia</i>. His surprise was increased
when, soon after his arrival, and while
he was preparing to go ashore to refresh himself
after his voyage, Kryptos, the captain of the
<i>Salaminia</i>, came on board the <i>Eros</i>.</p>
<p class='c010'>Alkibiades received him with the courtesy due
to so high a state official. Kryptos requested to
be allowed to speak to him alone. When they
had gone beneath the silken awning which served
as a sort of state cabin on the stern-deck, Kryptos
presented him with a despatch. There was something
strange about the old man’s manner.
Alkibiades opened it and read:</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>‘The Senate and the people of Athens to
Alkibiades, the son of Kleinias, strategos of the
Athenian fleet and army in Sicily.—You are
hereby required on receipt of this to return
immediately on board your own trireme to Athens,
in company with the sacred state trireme, the
<i>Salaminia</i>.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The words grew indistinct for a moment as
he read them, but he bowed to the Senate’s
messenger, and told him he was prepared to
follow whenever he should sail. The captain
added that he was charged by the Senate to
inform the strategos it was their wish that he
should not leave his ship that night, so that he
might be in readiness to sail next morning. Alkibiades
bowed again, something in the Eastern
fashion, and said he would obey in this, as in all
other things, the mandate of the Senate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst the officers of the <i>Salaminia</i> who had
come on board with the captain were some
acquaintances of the officers of the <i>Eros</i>. They
were glad of an opportunity to meet their friends,
and while the captain was holding his interview
with Alkibiades they hurriedly told what their
business was, and something of what had taken
place at Athens since the departure of the fleet.
They said that the strategos was recalled and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>office taken from him. They invited their friends
to come and see them that evening on board the
<i>Salaminia</i>. Then Kryptos, who had summonses
for others in the fleet, came up to them, and they
left the <i>Eros</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those who saw Alkibiades when he came out
upon the deck of his ship declared there was
an awful look upon his face, such as they had
never seen before. The younger men approached
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Are you going to suffer this, general? Will
you go back now, just as we are about to
obtain the greatest conquest yet recorded? Let
us send this process-server home again. And
when we return victorious the people will forget
our treatment of him. They will by that time,
too, have found out the injustice of their suspicions,
and perhaps have condemned those who
have persuaded them falsely of your guilt.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What guilt?’ cried Alkibiades, excited by the
word out of his wonted calm.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The Senate and the people, moved by the
priests of Demeter and the rest of the Eumolpidai,
have decreed your recall and the revocation
of your appointment on the charge of having
divulged and profaned the mysteries of Eleusis.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ye gods,’ cried Alkibiades, ‘who know my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>innocence, Demeter and Persephone be my witnesses
that I will be revenged on those who have
done me this dishonour! And the people have
decreed my revocation? The worse for those
who have misled them!’</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke with a fierceness so different to his
usual gentleness that his friends were terrified.
Only Kolyphôn stood forth, known as the Silent
One, and mildest of them all.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, my strategos, speak but the word, and we
will this moment publish through the fleet news
of this dishonour done to us. The whole fleet
is yours; ‘tis to you it owes its existence. This
state trireme shall be sent back with a fitting
message to your enemies, a word of courage to
your friends. Say but the word, and we will put
Nikias on board the <i>Salaminia</i> with Kryptos, and
send him home—the best place for such as he.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Peace!’ said Alkibiades. ‘We must obey
the people. Go, you who have been invited on
board the <i>Salaminia</i>. When you return, I will
speak with you again.’</p>

<p class='c010'>So he was left alone to ponder upon these
things, a prisoner on board the ship he had furnished
for the state. He knew that if the expedition
was to succeed he must be there to lead it, and
that it would break down if he went from it. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>knew the timid, procrastinating character of
Nikias—how he could never make up his mind
on an emergency, and would allow any excuse
to prevail rather than take action. He knew,
too, how necessary immediate action was, before
the Syrakusans recovered from their alarm and
felt their own strength, or learnt the weakness of
Nikias, or got help from Korinth or from Sparta.
And now he was to go and leave all; and by the
time he could come back to Sicily, absolved from
this foul charge, as he then believed he assuredly
must be, it would be too late.</p>

<p class='c010'>He thought of the quiet Kolyphôn’s advice to
appeal to the whole force. That would be a bold
stroke. It might succeed; but it was disloyal to
those who had entrusted him with power, disloyal
to his colleagues. Was it not treachery to Athens?</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he bethought him of his power over the
Assembly. Had he ever appealed to them in vain?
Had he ever failed to move them? Could he fail
now? Was he not more popular than ever?
Was not his cause more just? Should he not go
before them, throw himself upon their sense of
right; expose and destroy their enemies and his;
tell them what he had done already for them in
Sicily against the cowardly advice of Nikias;
ask them who was their true friend, he or Nikias;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and then—why, then, if need be, die, and let them
find out, when it was too late, when Nikias
brought back the fleet with nothing to show for
all their great expenditure, who it was that had
been done to death through their advisers?</p>

<p class='c010'>What a noble retaliation! Yet, after all, he
would be tried, not by the Assembly of the
people; they had but voted for his trial. He
would be tried by a limited number of dikastai,
many of them his enemies, and if the rest had been
so influenced, in his absence, by those who were
conspiring together to destroy him, would he be
listened to? Would he get justice from them?</p>

<p class='c010'>He saw the depth of the malice of Pythonikos—to
get rid of him so that he might work out
his machinations without hindrance. He remembered,
too, the fickleness of the people—how
they had turned on Perikles, after all he had done
for them. And religious frenzy! who can stem
that when once it rages in its delirious course let
loose from rational control?</p>

<p class='c010'>While here he was, as Kolyphôn had said, master
of the situation. The whole of the fleet friendly.
Most of the soldiers his own. The Argives and Mantineians
cared more for him than for all the rest
of the Athenians put together. They had come
upon the expedition mainly on his account,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>while they of Korkyra and the Ionians who had
joined the fleet at Korkyra, and made up between
them more than half the army, had learnt to
look on him as the genius of the enterprise, and
knew that the plans they had at heart against
Syrakuse could only be carried out under his direction.
As for the other generals, they soon had
seen that one was a traitor to the cause, the other
of no weight, and perfectly incompetent.</p>

<p class='c010'>These were the thoughts which chased each
other through his brain as he paced the <i>Eros</i>,
waiting for the news his friends might bring him
from the <i>Salaminia</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was late before they returned. There had
been much to hear, and what they heard had
startled them. Before they had come back, Alkibiades
had made up his mind that any attempt to
excite the army or the fleet to rebel against the
orders of the Senate was too hazardous, and might
lead he knew not where. Other schemes, indistinct
as yet, and scarcely entertained, began
to shape themselves vaguely in his mind. Rejected,
they came again, born of indignant rage,
of righteous anger. Might he not have a revenge
such as no other man had thought of? He
clenched his teeth, his hands, determined to
resist the suggestions whispered to his maddened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>mind. Then he mused again on all his wrongs—the
venal, treacherous Senate, the ungrateful,
stupid people. He clenched his teeth again,
this time in anger. Then the unformed schemes
took more decided shape. He let them stay
longer in his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had no further communication that night
with his officers when they returned. He retired
when he saw them coming, after giving orders
to his ship’s master to be ready to set sail the
first thing in the morning, and to give him notice
when he saw the <i>Salaminia</i> weigh anchor. All
night visions of his past, and visions of his future,
crowded on him as he lay awake, and became his
dreams when at last he slept.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brilliant dawn of a bright September
morning was breaking over the sea and the fairest
island in the world when his ship’s master gave
him warning that the <i>Salaminia</i> had weighed her
anchor, and was apparently about to sail. He
ordered his captain to prepare to leave the harbour
in the <i>Salaminia’s</i> wake. Before he appeared on
deck the <i>Eros</i> was outside the harbour, the
<i>Salaminia</i> some five hundred yards ahead.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a splendid morning, and the soft, fresh,
exhilarating air of Sicily breathed upon them as
the two fine ships, with oars bending and sails
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>swelling, swept the Sicilian Sea. Alkibiades joined
a group of his friends on deck. He had assumed
again his usual careless spirits.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And what news from Athens? Has Pythonikos,
or Andokides, or my dear brother Kallias—have
they accused us before the dikastai, condemned
us to death already, and confiscated all
our property?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No, Alkibiades,’ answered Kolyphôn; ‘not
yet; but if our news be true, they and other
enemies you suspect not are likely to do so soon.’</p>

<p class='c010'>For all his assumed carelessness, a black cloud
was seen by all of them upon his face as he called
sharply to that other to explain his meaning.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they told him all they knew; how that
after the departure of the fleet a sadness had
fallen over everyone, partly reaction from the
excitement of its preparation and its setting out,
more from the awe that the outrage to the statues
had produced. This feeling had changed to one
of wrath and indignation, roused by those who
bribed some of the meaner sort to bring false
accusations. Then Agaristé, a strange woman,
some distant relation of Alkibiades—at least, of
the same stock—declared she saw him and
Axiochos and Adeimantos make joke of the
Eleusinian mysteries in the house of Charmides.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>‘This woman’s story,’ added Biôtides, a stout
Athenian sailor, ‘was so absurd, Kleibôn said, it
would have been treated as an hysterical delusion
at any other time, but then it worked the common
people into a state of terrible alarm. This was
increased when Lydos, a slave, turned, it was
thought, unwittingly upon the oligarchic party,
and swore by all the gods that he had seen the
same thing done in the house of his master,
Perikles; and amongst the sacrilegious hands
was Leogoras, father of Andokides the orator.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ha, ha!’ cried Alkibiades; ‘Leogoras, who
breeds the finest pheasants in all Greece. I know
the old man; and what said his fine son the orator?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Well, the Senate offered ten thousand drachmas
and a pardon to anyone who would denounce the
spoilers of the images,’ said Kolyphôn. ‘And then—and
then a knave named Diokleides came in
haste before the Senate and declared that, while
he was journeying from Athens, on the night before
the images of the god Hermes were cut, he saw
about three hundred men close to the theatre
of Dionysos, that they then separated into small
bands, and that he would know them all again
if he saw them. When he came back next day,
it seems, he found the reward which had been
offered by the Senate, and he went to Andokides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and threatened that if he did not give him twelve
thousand drachmas he would denounce him and
all his family. Andokides promised the money,
but did not pay it, so he and his father were denounced
and both imprisoned, besides a number of
their relations. But the Senate having promised
to pardon them if the son would confess, Andokides
made a clean breast of it, and said he had been
one of a large number who agreed to cut the
statues. He gave the names of twenty-three
others, all well-known citizens, as his accomplices.
They were taken, condemned, and put to death, except
a few who escaped. Andokides himself has got
away, and many think those who were put to death,
through his evidence, were innocent, and that the
famous orator gave them up to shield his friends.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No one seems to know much for certain,’
said Biôtides. ‘The two charges are mixed
up together. It is impossible to get at the
bottom of it all. But the best thing is that
one of the “searchers” appointed by the Senate
to find out all about the Hermai is himself denounced
as one who was mixed up in it. Some
wise men think, so Minesias says, that Andokides
meant to lay the whole blame on you, Alkibiades,
but was afraid at last, because all men
knew he was your greatest enemy, and so might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>suspect him of having had the statues cut himself,
which was the truth. Others think it was
done only to stop the expedition.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘As like as not,’ said Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Well, then,’ continued Biôtides, ‘this scoundrel
Diokleides was found out. Andokides had sworn
there were no three hundred out that night, and
that those whose names had been given by the
informer were never near the theatre of Dionysos
at all. The Senate asked Diokleides how he
could tell the faces of the men he said he saw
by night. ‘Because it was full moon and very
clear,” said Diokleides. Now it happened to
have been a new moon and dark that night. So
Diokleides was convicted of giving false evidence,
and was condemned to death, and serve him right.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘A pity all these clumsy conspirators have not
been treated in the same way,’ said Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But wait, sir. When he found himself condemned
he said the whole tale had been made up
for him by Amiantos and your relative Alkibiades
of the deme of Phegusa. Orders were given at
once for their arrest. They both escaped, and
Alkibiades, it is said, has gone to Sparta. The
people are beside themselves with fear. They
know not what to do. Any base informer, it
seems, can get the best citizens condemned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>The only safe course left, when anyone may be
accused, is to fly from Athens. There is small
chance of justice for any in Athens now, the
people are in such a panic. But, Alkibiades,
the worst is yet to come. Thessalos, the son of
Kimon——’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ah! what of him? I know the ingenuity of
his malicious soul.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Thessalos delivered to the dikasterion a formal
accusation against Alkibiades, the son of Kleinias,
together with his friends Polytion, Theodorus, and
others, of having divulged and sacrilegiously made
sport of the Eleusinian mysteries.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And the five hundred dikastai, what said they?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Minesias says the people are in such bewilderment
they will do anything. Athens, when they
left, was under arms by night and day. “The
Boiotians are coming on us!” say some. “The
Spartans are at the isthmus,” say others. “The
Argives and the Spartans are both coming.
Alkibiades has sent them, and has told them
how they may take the city”; so many of them
run up and down crying. And then the priests
of Demeter have cursed you openly, and say the
earth will refuse to yield her fruits, and the
gods have abandoned Athens, and will not come
back till you have been recalled. And Pythonikos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and Thessalos, and many others of the oligarchs,
and some of the democrats, too, are going about
telling the people no good will ever come of this
expedition, and that the fleet and all the army
will be destroyed unless your command is taken
from you. They tell them that for years you have
been the most arrogant of men; that in secret
and amongst your friends you used to laugh at
the demos, and declared you would soon upset
the Constitution and make yourself tyrant in
Athens. A lot of lies like these and all the other
charges so exasperated the people against you,
Alkibiades, that the Assembly decreed that the
office of strategos should be taken from you, and
that you should be recalled to Athens to be tried
at once upon the charge made by Thessalos. But
Kryptos was especially ordered to say nothing of
your deposition while he was with the fleet, for
fear of causing a revolt among the sailors.’</p>

<p class='c010'>When he had heard all this, which was told him
in scraps, first by one, and then another, as each
remembered something of what he had heard
the night before, Alkibiades spoke as though
thinking to himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh, so they have revoked my office, have they?
And they think I shall come back to let them
try me before this dikasterion, do they?’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>His mind was made up. The <i>Salaminia</i> made
for Thurii, on the south coast of Italy. The <i>Eros</i>
followed close behind. As they neared the land,
Alkibiades called his friends round him, some of
whom had been ordered to return with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Are you all anxious to yield yourselves up
patiently to the good demos, who one day crown
and cheer their leader, and the next day would
deliver him to death?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Not I, nor I, nor I,’ cried they. ‘And this
is what we have been thinking of since we left
Katané.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Will Alkibiades give himself up to a people
who are unworthy of him?’ asked Kolyphôn.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And be led away to death when he could
overthrow them all?’ rough Agrestides said.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Or make a name for vengeance gratified, which
would astonish all the world, and live in men’s
memories for ever, as warning to an ungrateful
country?’ said Kolyphôn.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘All this have I been thinking of, too,’ said
Alkibiades, ‘since we have been following that
state trireme. No, Alkibiades shall not be carried
like a fly caught by a spider to its hole, there to
be executed at his captors’ will. Life is pleasant,
and we have yet a greater name to make.
We shall put in at Thurii, I expect. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>friends there a little pledged to me for favours I
have done them. If they will help us to avoid
the old fool Kryptos, will you share your fortunes,
come what will, with me?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed we will,’ they said in graver tones than
they were used to speak in.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘It may mean fighting to the death,’ said
Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘In fighting we would gladly die for you,’ said
Agrestides, with something of emotion on his
rugged face.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What fate were nobler? And how delightful
to enrage those hounds at Athens!’ muttered
Kolyphôn.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Keep with me, then, when we land at Thurii.
We shall most likely dine at the house of my
friend Eumanthes; he is much indebted to me.
That is his great house more than half-way up
the hill to the west there, almost hidden in the
olive-grove. His slaves must still be getting in
the vintage, one of the best in Italy. When we
have dined, and you hear me say the word
“Athanatos,” go out one by one, and wait for
me at the shrine of Dionysos, which you will
find at the right-hand side, at the end of his
garden, further up the mountain. Now, no
more of this! Remember, “Athanatos.”’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>It</span> was early in the afternoon of September the
twenty-fifth by our reckoning when the <i>Eros</i>,
following the <i>Salaminia</i>, got up to Thurii, an
Athenian colony near the site of the old-renowned
soft Sybaris. The fallen strategos landed with
his friends. Kryptos, approaching, told the ex-general
he proposed staying there that night, and
starting again early next morning. Alkibiades
bowed, saying it was his part to receive orders
now, not to give them.</p>
<p class='c010'>The people of Thurii, most of whom had come
upon the wharf to see the two great Athenian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>vessels, were indeed surprised when they recognised
the well-known face of Alkibiades. He
had lately called there, when, at the head of his
division of the fleet, he was on his way to Rhegion.
Eumanthes quickly heard the news, and came
down at once to welcome his friend and benefactor,
and invited him and his companions to his country
house, and begged they would make it theirs as
long as they might stay at Thurii.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘’Tis only till to-morrow,’ said Alkibiades,
introducing his friends. Eumanthes begged they
would stay longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Our partridges are good, and our wine thought
not the worst in Italy.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘So have I often heard, and, indeed, I know it
from my own experience,’ said the leader, who
wore his most gorgeous purple robe, and looked
ready to enjoy a long symposium after all the
rough labours of his recent voyages.</p>

<p class='c010'>And a fine symposium it was. Eumanthes,
after a little private talk with his old friend, had
summoned the wisest of the Thurians to meet
him. All the sage philosophers of Thurii came.
Their philosophy did not prevent them doing
justice to the feast. The daintiest fish of Thurii,
cooked, some in boiling olive-oil, others in the
white wine of the country, others stuffed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>olives and wild thyme and baked—all were delicious.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boiled turkeys, each with a hundred of the
famed Thurian oysters in them, and a boar’s
head, with freshly discovered truffles, were followed
by pheasants and young partridges, roasted and
stewed in many ways, which made the chief guest
declare that his own head cook Hymettos must
come to Thurii to improve his art. But the
snails, collected that afternoon from the vineyard
of white grapes, made them, for a moment, forget
all the rest; until a salad, with cray-fish, straight
from the cool mountain streams, made them
almost forget the snails. To the sound of silver
flutes boys came in, bearing upon golden dishes
the plump quails of Egypt, wrapped in the last
young leaves of the maturing vines, and offered
them upon bended knee to each guest, the virginal
vine-leaves giving a new flavour to the Egyptian
birds, which were sufficiently appetizing of themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>The custom of the luxurious Thurians was to
drink wine while the feast was being served, and
not to wait till after the various dishes had
been cleared away, as was the manner in the
older country. Each course was served up with
wines which had lain pining for the sunlight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for more than twenty years. Cold white wine,
which gave forth an aroma as of early summer
mignonette when the tall, pointed amphoræ were
opened, came with the fish and disappeared again
until the salad. Red wine, clear and delicate, gentle
as a maiden, gave flavour to the roasted venison.
Red wines of bolder nature, larger-hearted, with
perfume like the flower of the beech-tree on hot
summer nights, added a fresh charm to partridges
and pheasants. But all these wines were vanquished
by their king of exquisitely fine bouquet,
and of a vintage which the host admitted he had not
seen himself since he was a youth in his dear old
father’s lifetime. This monarch of all wine came
with the fruit—figs bursting with ripe lusciousness,
walnuts, and large bloomy grapes, with
the warmth still on them of the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The philosophers and the learned men of Thurii,
notwithstanding all the heat they were wont to
show in nightly arguments with one another, and
in discussing the latest works of every sophist
writer, were quiet and subdued before the renowned
Athenian. Then did he look more radiant
and beautiful than ever. Seldom did he show
such condescension or concern himself more
courteously to instruct and gratify his company.
He spoke of many things—of patriotism, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>love of country. When was man obliged to die
for his home? How far, if ever, was he bound to
save his fatherland, if he must appear an enemy
while doing it? Or was it not nobler to die to
save her than to live to teach her, and dying,
leave a fame behind which some day all would
recognise, so that his name would never die, and
he would become indeed ‘Athanatos’?</p>

<p class='c010'>The companions of his voyage rose from their
couches one by one, and stole out unnoticed by
the grave philosophers, overcome by the eloquence
they had listened to and the good wine
they had drunk. At length Alkibiades bade them
good-night, and his host got rid of them.
Eumanthes, after a few more words with his
guest, went down to the wharf to watch the
movements of the <i>Salaminia</i>. He found the
captain still superintending the provisioning of
the state ship, and invited him to come and stay
a day or two with him. Kryptos declined, as
he sailed for Athens the next morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Eumanthes returned he found that his
guest, who in the meantime had changed his dress
for one more suitable to the work before him, was
gone. He had reason to suppose his Athenian
friends were by this time beyond the shrine of
Dionysos. There Alkibiades and his companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>had found Diôtes, a faithful servant of
Eumanthes, with arms and horses and some
provisions, awaiting them. They mounted, and,
led by Diôtes, went along a narrow pathway
in single file up the mountain by the side of
the stream whence the cray-fish had come which
formed the chief part of the wondrous salad.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a dark night, and not without some
danger did they make their way to higher ground.
Biôtides was better at sea than on horseback.
In his anxiety to show his skill as a horseman, his
steed, unaccustomed to such a rider, got rid of
him. He was picked up near a precipice not
much the worse, but it was thought wiser to
make him exchange horses with Agrestides, who
was riding a milder animal. They went along
merrily enough, considering their new circumstances.
Only Alkibiades was silent and thoughtful.
Before daybreak they reached a small villa,
nearly thirty miles from Thurii, belonging to
Eumanthes. Here they rested.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were not sorry to lie down, though their
couches, all except one, were on the ground, and
made up of skins. What was that to sailors
after a long ride through the night? The day
was far advanced when Diôtes awoke them. He
had prepared a repast of goat’s milk and venison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>with some cheese and fruit. After that they set
out again on their journey, along a spur of the
lower Apennines for some three hours more, at
as quick a pace as Biôtides could keep up. Then
they descended into a broad valley, with a clear
stream running through it. At the end of this
valley, shut in on both sides by the hills, was a
goatherd’s hut. For this they made. Here
Diôtes put before them the remainder of the
provisions he had brought with him, and left
them in charge of Hermas, the goatherd, telling
them that he or some other of the servants
of Eumanthes would come as soon as possible
with news and more provisions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lodging was rougher than that of the night
before, but the spirits of all were high; those of
Alkibiades were now highest of them all. There
was something adventurous about this, and the
change from soft beds and silken coverlets, such
as were prepared for him on board the <i>Eros</i>, and
from the luxurious living he was accustomed to,
brought out a latent hardihood he was soon to find
an opportunity to show. His was a character which
could fit itself to any change of circumstances, to
any country, to any mode of life; but wherever
he might be he would be first, the most beloved,
often the most envied of mankind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Next morning they were up betimes. The
supplies Diôtes promised had not come, nor were
they wanted. The stream was full of trout, and
no party of schoolboys out on a holiday ever
abandoned themselves to greater frolic and enjoyment.
Alkibiades constructed a net to catch the
fish, and invented a new way of cooking them. By
the time they were spread out smoking on platters
made of leaves on the rich turf, the appetites of
the party would have made most fish delectable.
So what of this, the finest flavoured that the
streams of earth afford, and cooked by Alkibiades?
Hermas provided bread, coarse, perhaps, and somewhat
hard; but his cheese was excellent; and he
produced a basketful of those cray-fish we have
heard of twice before. He had caught and cooked
them while the others were fishing for the trout.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Stop,’ said Alkibiades; ‘I see a herb will make a
noble salad;’ and so it did with oil of which Hermas
had a store, made from the olives in the groves
through which they had passed two days before.
There was no wine there, and they wanted none.
The fresh mountain air in which they took their
breakfast,—a breakfast caught and cooked by
themselves, for the first time in the lives of most
of them,—made up for that. Alkibiades drank
from the mountain stream as it flowed by them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>clear and icy cold. ‘After all,’ said he, ‘water is
not so bad to drink—sometimes.’</p>

<p class='c010'>They had a mid-day slumber on the goatherd’s
skins, under the late September sun, and
were aroused by the arrival of two horsemen,
whom they recognised as servants of Eumanthes.
They brought a scroll on which was written:
‘Kryptos and his band are searching; keep
quiet and on guard.’ They also brought two
panniers filled with such succulent viands as only
a Eumanthes could imagine. At the evening
meal this pampering food seemed out of place in
their surroundings, and yet,—and yet, they eat it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next morning Diôtes came. Kryptos was still
looking for them, but on the wrong side. So all
that day, and for many others after it, the band
of fugitives enjoyed the sunshine and the mountain
air, and the good things the gods provided.
And then news came that Kryptos, giving up his
search at last, had set sail for Athens. The
fugitives started on their journey back. They
bade farewell to Hermas and his quiet valley;
and oftentimes in after-years, amidst the splendours
of the East, and all his luxuries, his troubles
and his triumphs, the wandering Alkibiades looked
back to that sweet spot, and wondered which was
happier, he or Hermas.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>On</span> his return to Thurii Alkibiades found Kryptos
had indeed gone and taken the <i>Eros</i> with him.
So he waited there for news from Athens. It
was not long in coming. He heard how, as soon
as it was known that he had escaped at Thurii,
the dikasterion, in his absence, had sentenced him
to death and confiscated all his property.</p>
<p class='c010'>‘But I will show them I am still alive,’ he said.
No one ever kept a promise better.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he was dead to his country by his country’s
act, his country became dead to him. Great as
had been his devotion to that country in the past,
great as it would ever have been, had she been
worthy of it, great as it was yet to be proved to
be in the distant future, at this time the one
thought which engrossed his mind became how to
make his revenge as overwhelming in its destructive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>consequence as her injustice had been great
to him. It was so complete and terrible that the
vengeance of no man has been like to it in the
history of the ages.</p>

<p class='c010'>He despatched Agrestides to Messana with
information to the chiefs of the Syrakusan party
of the agreement he had made with their opponents
to open the city gates to the Athenian army.
With the rest of his companions he sailed for Elis
and landed at Kylléné.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Agrestides, who was trusted with the
message to the leaders hostile to the Athenians
at Messana, was one on whose judgment and
quiet sagacity Alkibiades had found he could
implicitly rely. He was originally a poor Arkadian
shepherd boy, troubled with the wandering
spirit which has driven many another boy to
leave his home and happy solitude, to be tossed
about on the world’s wide waves, to hope, and
long, and travel, to see many lands and divers
peoples, and die at last unknown, unrecognised,
and be buried amongst strangers. He could
not be contented to tend his sheep in the
peaceful valleys of Arkadia. The spirit of unrest,
of adventure, which came over him, he could
not resist. The desire to be elsewhere, to get
past the mountains which shut in his native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>plains, grew into a force which became ever
more and more resistless. The constant itching
to be gone spoilt all his happiness. When the
father and the mother and all of them were there,
in the small family festivities, the temptation
haunted him. In the gray morning light, when
the others were asleep, he would gaze where the
coming sun began to tinge the clouds, and the
longing to be there where the sun rose saddened
his days, and when it set over the distant hills
his fever to be away, to see the world, to leave
his uneventful life, burnt into his brain.</p>

<p class='c010'>He dreamed at night of other lands, and strange
great cities, and the unknown, mysterious sea he
had heard men talk about who had actually been
on it. So he left his sheep, and his mother, all
his people—only his brother knew for certain he
was going and reaching Korinth, he got on board
a merchant ship that traded with the East. He
soon became a skilful sailor. He had strength
and endurance, as well as an intelligence and
shrewdness about him; and getting to Athens,
he was in time noticed by the captain of the <i>Eros</i>,
and engaged to serve with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the time he first saw the owner of this
wondrous craft he looked on him with awe and
reverence. It so happened that he was able more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>than once to be of service to his lord. So when
the <i>Eros</i> set out for Sicily, Agrestides—‘Aglestides’
his master, who was in the habit of lisping,
always called him—was promoted, and kept in
close attendance on the strategos. The Arkadian
was captivated like the rest—the feeling of awe
changed to one of loyal, distant, enthusiastic love,
intense devotion. But what could the poor sailor
say or do to show his admiration? One day,
perhaps, he might do something. He might even
save his hero’s life. Perhaps he might—best of
all—show his affection by giving his life for him.
He had both his wishes.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was mid October before Alkibiades reached
the mainland of the Peloponnesos. The people,
when they heard who it was, went down in crowds
to meet him. He made a triumphant entry into
Elis, where, too, the people thronged to see the
far-famed conqueror at the Olympic games, as
though he had been some mythic hero of antiquity,
who had come in this disguise to visit them,
greater in disgrace than most men in prosperity.</p>

<p class='c010'>He did not stay long in Elis. Plans were
forming in his teeming brain, and must not be
delayed. He sent to the Kings and Ephors of the
Spartans for a safe-conduct to their capital, telling
them that he might be able, as their friend, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>do them greater service than, as their enemy,
he had done them injury. The Lakedaimonians
eagerly invited their old opponent to come to
them at once; he as eagerly left the Eleian capital
for Sparta. Before the winter had set in he found
himself, for the first time, among that hard and
rugged people.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were curious to see one of whom they
had heard so many strange accounts. Great was
their wonder when they beheld the grave severity
of his demeanour. They had been told tales of
his fabulous luxury and extravagance—tales which
had not been lessened in the telling. He dressed
himself as the plainest citizen there. The flowing
purple robe we last saw him wear in the house
of his good friend Eumanthes he left behind at
Elis. These simple-faring folk had heard tell of
his many cooks, the battery of copper saucepans,
and other paraphernalia of his kitchen, which
must be taken with him even to the wars; they
saw him eating at the common table of the coarse
food of Sparta. They had been scandalized at
the description of his costly baths of curious
perfumes; they saw him bathing on winter mornings
in the frozen river. And this went on for
many months while he was carrying out his
great designs. He met the leading men in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>council frequently, and showed them how they
might advance their state while humbling Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the spring came he heard how things
were going on in Sicily—how Nikias had tried
to enter Messana, and found, to his astonishment,
that the gates were not opened to him; how that
then he had gone back to Naxos and Katané,
and wasted all the remainder of the autumn and
winter doing nothing—wasting precious time
and Athenian treasure while Syrakuse was
strengthening her defences.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this while he had his agents at work in
Korinth. Late in the spring of 414, hearing that
Nikias had at length made up his mind to attack
Syrakuse, that his ships had entered the bay of
Thapsos, and that his troops were on the hills
above the town, he got leave to address the Lakedaimonian
assembly. He found an audience very
different from that which had so often been moved
by him at Athens. Only members of the old
Lakonian families sat here, who were intensely
conservative; it was no easy task to gain their
confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>He began in a diffident, half-apologetic strain,
open and unaffected. He reminded them that
his ancestors for many generations had been the
‘proxenoi’ of Sparta, their friends and agents;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>that no important business of their state had had
to be done in Athens but his progenitors had aided
them, and that none of their citizens ever became
entangled in their private affairs but his progenitors
had come to their assistance; and he
impressed upon them that on his entry into public
life he found a democratic Constitution had been
long established. Was it for him to upset that
Constitution? ‘And after all,’ he asked, ‘what
is the first reason for the existence of a democracy
but to oppose and ward off tyranny? Such as
I found it I adopted it, and did my best to make
it perfect. I and my ancestors before me found
ourselves placed at the head of a democracy
because of our known hatred of a tyranny. For,
as amongst you it is your ancient oligarchy
which saves your land from despotism, in Athens
it is democracy which wards off this danger. We
have striven to teach the people to rule themselves
with moderation, that so they might conserve the
Constitution as it came to them, in its grandeur
and its liberty, that so they might stop the first
efforts of a tyranny to raise its head, or scheme to
bring about a revolution. It is these insidious
foes we have ever fought; it is to them I owe my
exile. Democracies may have many faults—I
know it more than anyone. Would it have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>right in me to attempt to overthrow a long-standing
Constitution while you and other enemies
were at our doors?</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Having said so much about myself and my
own conduct, will you permit me, oh ye Lakedaimonians,
to give you some practical advice and
information? We did not sail to Sicily merely
to assist the Egestæans or the Greek colonists.
We intended, and the Athenians still intend, if
they can, after completely subjugating Sicily, to
turn their forces upon Italy. Sicily won, Italy
would soon be theirs. Enriched by the contributions
they would force from those lands, they
could attack Carthage and her dependencies. If
the Athenians succeed there, then, by the spoils
of these rich peoples, they will be able to enlarge
their fleet till it becomes larger than those of all
the world together. With such a fleet it is
intended to blockade the hostile ports of Greece,
to become rulers of the Peloponnesos and of the
whole Grecian land, and masters of the world.
Such is their intention.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Remember, you are hearing of these designs
from the mouth of one who helped to form them,
from one who did something towards carrying
them out. While I was in Sicily, I saw a good
deal of that country, and I tell you plainly, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>you do not act at once, Syrakuse must fall, and
with it Sicily, and all the other plans and hopes
of the Athenians may be accomplished. Then
you will have to look to your home. It will be
too late to think of Sicily or your allies. Furnish,
then, your ships without delay. Fill them with
your bravest hoplites. Above all things, put over
them your ablest general.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I will tell you one thing more. If you wish
to drive the Athenians from Sicily, if you wish to
frustrate their designs, if you wish to weaken them
at home, you must attack them in their own
country. You must take, and you must fortify,
Dekeleia, in Attika. That is what the Athenians
dread the most; that is the most deadly blow
you can aim at them. It would take long to
enumerate all the advantages you will gain
thereby. The Syrakusans will be encouraged to
hold out against their besiegers. It will prevent
the Athenians sending reinforcements. They will
want all their men to protect them at home. It
will stop a great part of their supplies of food
coming from their fertile fields. It will stop the
silver coming from the mines at Laurion. It
will, by degrees, detach from Athens the islands
and towns which are now allied to her by the
treaty of Delos, but which love her not. Many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>these, even now, are looking for the first opportunity
to shake off her heavy imposts and ally
themselves to you. It will turn the wavering
who have not yet determined to which side to
look for help. It will close her tribunals, to which
the islands and the smaller states dependent upon
her are now obliged to take their causes, and she
will thereby lose the large revenues she now receives
from the fees paid to her by those litigants.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Do not suspect the advice I tender you, nor
fear, because I counsel you against my country,
that my advice is insincere. I would not wound
my country, but my country’s secret enemies,
who, by abusing the power of her laws, thrust
out her truest friends from her. I seek not to
destroy my country; I seek only to regain her.
He shows his love of country most who does
what in him lies to purge his country of her
enemies at home, and to force her to receive
again those true sons who have been driven from
her by her foes. To gain this end I will spare no
pains, avoid no labour, fear no dangers, in your
service. Just as I inflicted great injury upon you
as your opponent in open war, so now as your
friend I am able to be of the greatest service to
you. By following the twofold counsel I have
given you, you will gain peace at home and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>empire of all Greece, which will freely give herself
to you without restraint.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The sincerity of his avowal that he wished to
use his present hosts as a means to recover his
rights at home; the obvious wisdom of his
counsel; the simple eloquence of his whole
address, without ornament or flowers of rhetoric,
won the confidence of the plain Lakonian people.
Indeed, he knew his audience. His apology for
the democratic part he had played at home was
a masterpiece of pleading, showing how the
party of popular freedom at Athens and the
strict oligarchic government of Sparta had the
same end in view—the hatred, the apprehension,
of anything approaching to a despotism; while
his plain, pathetic peroration, in which he stood
forth as the true friend of Athens, softened
towards him the hardest heart, and the most
suspicious intellect of his Spartan audience.</p>

<p class='c010'>His words, as far as we can find trace of them,
give little notion of the grave solicitude with which
he mixed up his cause with that of his hearers,
and brought vividly before them his earnest
hopes, his heartfelt wrongs. His success is another
proof—though no proof is wanting—of the injustice
of the charge brought against him by his
enemy Thukydides, that he had tricked and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>meanly cheated the Spartan envoys while they
were guests of his at Athens. For he was trusted,
and his honest declaration won its end. It
vanquished fears and hesitations, and persuaded
the Lakonians to join with the Korinthians in
sending aid to Syrakuse.</p>

<p class='c010'>This aid came just in time. As long as
Lamachos lived some little energy was shown
by the Athenians, in spite of the sluggishness
and cowardice of Nikias. When the large force
under the two remaining generals at length
came upon Syrakuse, the citizens could hardly
hope to hold out long against it. But Lamachos
was killed in an engagement, and from that time
Nikias did little but beg for more money, more
ships and men from home. Syrakuse, however,
was reduced by force of the numbers of its
besiegers to the last extremity. It was on the
point of surrendering when Gongylos, the Korinthian
commander, who had been despatched to
Sicily on the advice of Alkibiades, was allowed,
by the negligence of Nikias, to enter the port
of Syrakuse. He persuaded the people to remain
firm a little longer, for a Korinthian fleet
was on its way, and Gylippos, a Spartan general,
was even now landing in Sicily. By the like
negligence of the unfortunate Athenian commander,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Gylippos was allowed to land on the
north coast of Sicily, march unmolested through
the island, and at length enter Syrakuse, almost
surrounded, as it was, by the besiegers’ works.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gylippos almost immediately took the field
against the Athenians. Athens, entreated by
the desponding Nikias, in the following autumn
sent out to him a force even larger than the
first, with seventy-five ships and two more
generals. All was of no avail. Disaster followed
on disaster, relieved by few and, for the most
part, unimportant gains. Before the summer of
413 was over Alkibiades heard that such of his late
comrades as had not been either killed in battle or
drowned in their shameful flight, lay starving and
rotting in the Syrakusan quarries, into which
they had been thrown by their victorious enemies.
The splendid fleet with which two years before
he had set out from Athens, together with its
reinforcements, had been destroyed by his new-found
friends, and his colleague Nikias, the unhappy
cause of all the evil, had been taken
prisoner and put to death.</p>

<p class='c010'>So far his prophecy made to the Spartan
assembly had come true. The rest was to be
verified.</p>

<p class='c010'>His other counsel had been acted on. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Spartans, under Agis, had taken and fortified
Dekeleia, and were overrunning Attika. Athens
could see from the Akropolis the rising walls
threatening her with immediate danger. The
citizens were forced to live prepared to fight at
any moment. Their fields were ravaged, their
commerce well-nigh ruined, the mines shut up,
even the tribunals closed. The allied towns
from which, by the terms of the confederation
of Delos, she was to receive a great part of her
revenues were falling from her or growing luke-warm
in her cause. The neutral states were
looking to her more successful rival, and yet the
vengeance of Alkibiades was not satisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the autumn embassies came to Sparta from
Tissaphernes, satrap of the Persian King in
Ionia, and from Pharnabazos, satrap of the
country near the Hellespont, offering alliance
against Athens. Alkibiades advised the Spartans
to postpone all thought of carrying their arms
to the Hellespont, but he saw of what advantage
an alliance with Tissaphernes would be in carrying
out his present plans. An alliance was therefore
concluded between Lakedaimôn and the
satrap of Ionia. By the terms of this treaty,
which was soon after ratified by both parties,
the Persian was to bring a large fleet to aid the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Spartans, and to pay the wages of those employed
on board the Spartan fleet.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time an offer of alliance came from
Chios, the richest and most important of the
Grecian islands, near the continent of Asia Minor.
Chios was still nominally a member of the confederation
of Delos, in alliance with, and bound to
pay an annual tribute to, Athens. The Spartans
knew the strength it would give them if they
could cut away this strong support from their
opponents. They promised to send a fleet of
forty triremes to aid Chios in her revolt, and to
act in concert with her new ally and ancient
enemy, the Persian. In the spring of 412 these
ships, with those of others of the Spartan allies,
reached Lechaion, the western port of Korinth,
and were hauled over the isthmus to Kenchreia,
the eastern port, where they lay, ready to start
for Chios as soon as the Isthmian games were
over.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime the Euböians had made the
like offer of alliance to Agis, the Spartan king, at
Dekeleia, and asked for the same assistance against
Athens. The required help was promised. Before
this aid could be given, and while Agis waited for
reinforcements for that purpose, Lesbos revolted,
and prayed the same aid from Agis. A small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>force arrived at this time from Sparta, and was
sent on at once by Agis to help the Lesbians.</p>

<p class='c010'>But while this conspiracy was going on against
her Athens was not idle. Like a lion brought
to bay, she roused herself as dangers quickened
round her. Her army gone, her great fleets
sunk or burnt at Syrakuse, her food-supplies
diminished, her revenues almost destroyed, without
money or allies on whom she could depend,
the whole state in mourning for the sons who
never could return to her again from that
sad Sicilian expedition, the islands and the
tributary towns which she had rescued from the
Persians, and guarded from their other enemies,
revolting from her, or gone right over to a foe
who was plotting with those very Persians to
destroy her utterly, she rose majestic in her
grief; the word ‘surrender’ was not so much as
named—never breathed by any citizen; the idea
of compromise was never for a moment entertained.
Each blow as it came quick upon her
roused her to fresh vigour. The ingratitude, the
shameless ingratitude, of those small states, of
which for nearly sixty years she had been the
constant safeguard, might burn into her soul,
but it did not shake her. In the past, perhaps,
she sometimes domineered over them in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>pride, and taken large tribute from them in the
days of her power. But she protected them from
ever-prowling enemies, and gave them back more
than she took from them. And now—now in
her distress—they were deserting her, going over
to an enemy who, for his own immediate and
selfish purpose, was not unwilling to undo what
the pan-Hellenic federation had done, and it
seemed that Marathon and Salamis had been
fought in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, let them go if they must go; she, to her
last ship, to her last timber, to her last man, to
her last drachma, she would still fight, and, if
the gods decreed it, she would die fighting. As
long as her liberty should last and her democracy
should remain, she would never lose her courage.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was a country to be proud of, a race to
boast about. Did her great son far away in
Lakedaimôn, while he was counselling, directing
all the movements of her foes against her—did he
ever in his heart feel a secret pride that he was
sprung from her? Was his just wrath ever so
little cooling, or did it still burn so fiercely that
he could not see her glory?</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenian Ekklesia decreed the creation of
a new fleet, the suppression of every expense not
actually necessary, the immediate fortification of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Sounion, to prevent her corn supplies from being
cut off by sea, as they had been by land. Aristokrates
was sent to Chios, where the oligarchic
party was expecting every day the arrival of the
promised Spartan fleet. There he demanded
assistance according to the terms of the treaty of
Delos. They delayed him as long as they could,
and until they began to despair of aid from
Sparta. The democratic party at Chios, as in
other places, still clung, though coldly, to the
Athenian alliance. At last they provided seven
triremes fully manned. With these Aristokrates
hastened back to Athens. Adding them to some
thirty others, which were all the Athenians could
get together, they determined to stop, if possible,
the joint fleet of Sparta and her allies from leaving
Kenchreia. That fleet had got into the Saronic
Gulf before the Athenian and Chian ships came
up with them, but was then forced to take refuge
in another Corinthian port. There the Athenians,
having landed some of their hoplites, attacked
the enemy by sea and land, slew many of
them, including their admiral, and blockaded
the whole fleet.</p>

<p class='c010'>On news of this disaster reaching Sparta, the
new friends of Alkibiades were for giving up the
expedition at once, and would have done so but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>for him. The oligarchic Lakedaimôn did not, at
this period, prove itself so steadfast in misfortune
as its democratic sister in Attika had done. But
the determined spirit of Alkibiades moved amongst
the Spartans indefatigably. It needed, indeed,
all his energy and power of persuasion to keep
them up to their engagements with the Persian
Tissaphernes and with Chios.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Let me go off at once to Chios before news of
the blockade of your fleet is known. They will
trust me more than anyone. The picture I shall
draw of the Athenian distress, and the readiness
you will show by sending me to their assistance,
will so encourage them in their revolt that this
slight reverse on the Korinthian coast will not
endanger our great plans.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He worked privately, too, among the Ephors,
especially with his friend and relative Endios,
who was not fond of Agis. He put before him
the advantage he would gain personally over his
rival if he obtained the whole credit of making
and carrying out the treaty with the Persian king.</p>

<p class='c010'>He again prevailed, and started off at once
with Chalkideus, one of the ablest of the Lakedaimonian
admirals, and only five triremes for
Chios, leaving Agrestides behind to look after
his affairs at Sparta. The voyage was unusually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>rapid; it was too slow for his impatience. For
more than two years he had been living inactively
at Sparta. Since November, 415, to this the early
spring of 412, his life had not been quite what
he would have chosen. The frugal fare and the
simple Spartan life was all very well, but two
years and a half of it was quite enough for him.
There were none of the gay Athenian spirits there,
no banquets, no symposia, no fun or frolic—all
heavy, dull, rude decorum. What little amusement
he did get, if report says truly, nearly cost
him his life. But we cannot trust all that report
says of him during those two years and a half at
Sparta.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Chios</span>, the richest of all the rich, luxuriant islands
of the Grecian Archipelago, celebrated for the
beauty of its women and its wine, rose like a nymph
from the waters of the Aigaian, bathed in the
sunlight of a bright spring morning, as Alkibiades
came in sight of it. Peaceful and serene, these
Grecian islands off the Asiatic coast overflowed
with happiness and plenty; some of them, Chios
in particular, soon to be the scene of plunder and
of terrible bloodshed.</p>
<p class='c010'>The two leaders thought it prudent to put into
Kasystes, a small town belonging to Teos, on the
continent hard by. There they met some members
of the oligarchic party of Chios; for Chios,
like other Grecian States, was divided in opinion
as to the respective merits of the two forms of
government. The oligarchic Teians advised an
immediate descent upon the island, before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>people, who were democratic, and disliked the
newly-proposed alliance with Sparta, could hear
of their approach. This advice was taken, and
the Lakedaimonian squadron of five triremes
appeared at Chios, to the surprise of all except
the oligarchs, who had been warned of their
approach. A meeting of the insular assembly
was held. Alkibiades addressed them, and declared
that these five ships were only the advance
guard of a large fleet that was coming. His
eloquence gained the people to his side; no one
seemed able to withstand his persuasion. The
Chians of both parties declared for the Lakedaimonian
alliance, and lightly threw off the
gentle yoke of Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Erythrai, the neighbouring town upon the
coast, followed the example of the Chians. Alkibiades
set off for Klazomenai, and persuaded the
people there to join the new confederation against
Athens. He was making up, indeed, for his late
enforced inaction, everywhere at once, and was
everywhere successful, serving his new friends
well and faithfully, and bringing all beneath the
spell of his potent personality.</p>

<p class='c010'>But neither were his countrymen at Athens
quiet. They, as he knew, possessed a treasure
of ten thousand talents, laid up by his cousin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Perikles, never to be used save at the last peril
of the state. By law it was death to anyone
who should even propose to touch this fund,
unless a hostile fleet was actually approaching
Athens. That law was now for the first time abrogated,
and part of the money was used to equip
a number of triremes. The seven ships of the
Chians which had been taking part unwillingly
in the blockade of the Spartan fleet were brought
to the Peiræus. They were manned by Athenian
sailors, and with some twelve or thirteen other
ships under Strombichides were sent straightway
to Ionia. Strombichides brought his ships to Teos
on the mainland, hoping by this show of strength
to keep the Teians faithful. Chalkideus and Alkibiades
came after him with their fleet, now increased
to twenty-five, by an addition of Chian
ships and some more from the Peloponnesos.
They were supported, too, on land by a body of
soldiers from Klazomenai and by some Persian
barbarians under the command of Stagès, the
lieutenant of Tissaphernes. It was some time
since Persian barbarians had been seen fighting
in support of a Grecian state.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strombichides, finding himself in this way attacked
by sea and land, sailed off, followed by
Chalkideus, who chased the Athenian ships as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>far as Samos. Alkibiades, with some other of
the Spartan ships, sailed for Miletos, another
town of Ionian origin, on the Asiatic continent,
where he had many friends. He easily persuaded
the inhabitants to join the league against his
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many reinforcements to each side arrived,
during this time, upon the scene. Slight advantages
were gained by both parties. At Samos
the people, staunch democrats, rose in rebellion,
and treated their oligarchic landlords roughly.
They slew two hundred of these political opponents,
banished four hundred more of them from
Samos, and shared their lands amongst themselves.
A democratic government was established, with
the exiled Hyperbolos at its head. He had gone
there on his unsuccessful attempt to ostracize
Alkibiades, and was now leader of the popular
party at Samos. The new government would
have naught to do with Sparta. On the other
hand, the Spartan fleet, which was blockaded by
the Athenians near the Peiræus, broke out, inflicting
some damage as it went, and augmented
by fresh ships under Astyochos, who was made
Admiral of all the Peloponnesian fleet in Ionia,
joined the rest of the Spartan force on the Ionian
coast. Thus the two great fleets, each with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>full force of hoplites, were drawing towards each
other in the eastern Aigaian Sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miletos, the most important town upon the
coast, and Chios were both invested by Athenian
ships. Throughout the summer many small engagements,
both by sea and land, were fought
between the contending powers. In one of them
Chalkideus, the friend and companion of Alkibiades,
was slain. As autumn approached, the
war concentrated round Miletos. A further supply
of ships and men under one Phrynichos, and two
other leaders, arrived from Athens, and with them
came fifteen hundred Argives, still true to their
allegiance. The ships joined the blockade of
the port, after landing some troops, including the
Argives, and laid siege to Miletos.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Alkibiades was in the town working day
and night to get the Milesian militia, about eight
hundred strong, in fit order to make a desperate
sortie. Besides these Milesians there was a body
of over a thousand Spartan hoplites and a good
force from Klazomenai within the walls of Miletos.
There was also another person there who was
to play no unimportant part in the remainder of
the life of Alkibiades—Tissaphernes had come
with some Persian cavalry. It was the first
time these two men had met—the first time the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>finest gentleman in Greece had come into actual
contact with the Persian nobleman and high
official. The Persian was captivated by the
pleasant manners, the wit, the varied powers,
the commanding presence and personal beauty
of the descendant of the ancient heroes of a
race which the Persians had such good cause to
hold in high respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>The day at length arrived—it had seemed long
in coming to the impatient exile—when the final
effort must be made to drive the Athenians from
the walls of Miletos. Much depended on that
day’s work. If the Spartans and their allies
could succeed in driving the Athenians to their
ships, the whole fleet might be attacked at sea,
while they were encumbered by the number of their
troops on board, together with the wounded and
the dying, after the engagement on the land. It
was known, too, that another formidable Spartan
squadron which had sailed some time since had
been seen making for Iasos, not far off, and might
soon be at Miletos. If the Athenian fleet and
army were both beaten, the other islands and
dependencies of Athens, which had feared up to
this time to declare themselves, would rise against
her domination. Thus, as far as anyone could
see, this great effort might decide her fate.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>At daybreak the city gates were opened. The
Milesians, instructed and inspirited by Alkibiades,
who led them, rushed on the Argive fifteen hundred
who confronted them on the left of the Athenian
siege-works. At the same time the Spartans
and Klazomenians, issuing from the eastern gate,
reached the Athenian right and centre works.
Tissaphernes was so astonished at the way in
which Alkibiades took his Milesians into action
that he forgot to charge at the head of his Persian
cavalry, and reserved them to pursue the enemy
when the others should have put them to flight.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus Alkibiades, by a strange vicissitude of
fortune, found himself face to face in deadly
combat with his old friends the Argives, with
whom he had no quarrel, whose alliance he had
gained for Athens, and whom, by his influence,
he had kept constant to her. These thoughts,
which could not but come upon him as he led
his Milesians against them, did not prevent him
from doing desperate work among them. They
broke and fled before him, leaving three hundred
dead upon the field.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side of the city other events were
taking place. The Spartans and men of Klazomenai
were utterly discomforted by the Athenian
hoplites. On seeing this rout of their allies, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Milesians feared to pursue the Argives farther,
lest the victorious Athenians might come round
and outflank them, and, in spite of all their leader
could do, they retired into the town by the gate
from which they had rushed out. They found,
when they returned, a host of Spartans and
Klazomenians entering the town in terror and
confusion, beaten back by those Athenians they
had boasted the day before they could drive into
the sea. The gates were closed, but the Athenians
sat down again before the town, cutting it off
almost entirely from supplies by land, while the
fleet blockaded its port.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miletos must soon have fallen but for Alkibiades.
He got out of the town as soon as it
was dark, and eluding the besiegers, rode as hard
as he could go all night, and in the morning
reached Teichioussa, a small fortified place on
the north coast of the Gulf of Iasos. There he
found the long-expected fleet from Sparta under
Theramenes. He put before him the critical
position of Miletos, and induced him to dare to
sail at once, in spite of the Athenian fleet, to its
relief. They arrived at Miletos that same day,
and the Athenians, acting on the unvalorous
advice of Phrynichos, when they heard of their
approach, although they had a larger fleet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>that fleet manned by Athenian sailors, drew off
their ships and their besieging forces and retired
to Samos. Thus Miletos was saved by the
energy and persuasion of Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>Athens, although her generals were showing the
unaccustomed sight of an Athenian fleet retiring
before Spartans—Athens at home was still working
with the utmost vigour, sending forth armament
after armament, as fast as she could get them
ready. She now had, partly at Samos, partly investing
Chios, a fleet of no less than one hundred
and twenty ships of war—a large array for a
people supposed by their enemies and those who
did not know them to be at their last gasp.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lakedaimonians were also working, doing
something for themselves and expecting more
from others. They sent forward some ships they
had received from Thurii and Syrakuse and
twenty-seven of their own. But what they
counted on more than anything was the promised
naval aid from Persia. Tissaphernes had
undertaken to bring an enormous fleet of three
hundred sail, now lying off the Phœnikian coast,
and only waiting orders from the Great King.
With these the Spartans hoped to sweep the
Athenians from the sea, and take from her her
islands and dependencies. Those which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>formerly under the tyranny of the Persian kings
were, by the treaty, to return to that dominion.
With the others, if there were any, Sparta might
do as she listed.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the last squadron of thirty-seven ships
from Lakedaimôn were sent eleven commissioners
as a council of war, with full powers over the
admirals, and instructions to get fresh concessions
from the Persian ally, and to press Tissaphernes
to bring his great fleet into Ionian waters
without delay. The commissioners brought with
them another secret order for Astyochos, the
admiral-in-chief.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agis was now back in Sparta for a time. He
was, perhaps, the ablest man they had, and had
done good work for his country at Dekeleia,
whither he had been sent at the advice of Alkibiades.
On his return home he heard of nothing
but the greatness, the powers, the courage, the
wisdom and ability, of their new councillor. Who
was this effeminate Athenian who seemed to
be ruling everyone in Sparta? A traitor to his
country, and one who, as like as not, would soon
prove a traitor to them! Agis was consumed
with jealousy. It is said he had another cause
for being jealous, of a more private nature, nearer
home. Be that as it may, he hated Alkibiades,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>his rival. The rival was away. Had he been
there it might have been different, but he was
away fighting and directing the battles of Lakedaimôn.
He had added fresh claims to their
gratitude. He had gained over many of the
Athenian allies by his presence and persuasion.
By his skill and courage he had defeated the
Argives at Miletos, and it was now known that
the whole remnant of that contingent, twelve
hundred men, had gone back again to Argos disgusted
when they found they had to fight against
him. Then by his promptitude and zeal he had
saved Miletos, and the Spartan army, which, but
for him, might now have been in the hands of
a victorious enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he was away. Others besides Agis hated
him with the hatred of smaller minds towards a
greater, a cause of hatred of which he had felt
the dire effects before at home. There were others
who, not hating him, thought Sparta had got all
she was likely to get out of him, and wished to
get rid of him, and knew of only one safe way of
doing so. He had few amongst the governing
Spartans to take his part. His friend and companion,
the brave Chalkideus, was slain. His
friend and relative Endios was no longer Ephor.
By secret suspicions artfully spread amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>those of the new Ephors who were not hostile
to him, they were at length persuaded that it
was necessary for the state that he should be
destroyed. He had done too much for Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Ephors had almost despotic powers. They
could even imprison their kings. But their power
lasted only for a year. So what they meant to
do against Alkibiades they must do speedily and
secretly. They resolved on his assassination. They
had a simple but sure method of communicating
with their commanders at the seat of war. The
Ephors had a staff of office of precisely the same
shape and size as the commander’s baton. Round
this they rolled a sheet of parchment and wrote
their deadly message on it, which doomed Alkibiades
to a sudden death. This scroll was then
unrolled. When it was off the staff it was
illegible, and not till it was rolled round the commander’s
staff could it be deciphered. It was
then entrusted to one of the commissioners to
carry to Astyochos at Miletos.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there were five Ephors, and one of them
was bound by strong ties to Endios. He, moreover,
was doubtful of the wisdom of the murderous
deed upon which his colleagues had
decided. He told the secret to Endios shortly
before the eleven commissioners were to set out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>from Sparta. Endios was dismayed at the disgrace
which this base act would bring on his country
He was horrified at the fate awaiting his kinsman,
to whom he was sincerely attached, and
from whom, while he was great and powerful at
Athens, he had received nothing but kindness and
hospitality. But what could Endios do? He
saw the villainy of the plot; he knew that Agis
was the chief mover in it, and that Agis hated
Alkibiades. He had not much love himself for
Agis, and would do anything he could to intercept
his malice. Whatever was to be done to
warn the object of this secret machination must be
done at once. If it was discovered that Endios
had betrayed the secret, it would be certain
destruction to him and to the Ephor, his informant.
He dared not trust it to any Lakedaimonian.
All the town would hear of it at once,
for the commons loved their Athenian guest;
he had won their hearts, as he had won the hearts
of the poor wherever he had gone. Endios dared
not confide it to a Spartan.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen that Agrestides was left behind
by Alkibiades to attend to his private affairs
when his master went with Chalkideus. Endios
found him out and imparted to him the secret
which he dare not put in writing. The rage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the faithful follower against king Agis and the
Ephors could at first hardly be restrained.
But he saw the necessity of departing at once
to warn his master. He easily got employed on
board one of the triremes which was just about
to start, for the Spartan government found it was
not easy to supply men enough for all the ships
they had lately sent to sea. So when, at the solstice,
the new squadron left the shore of Malea, with the
eleven commissioners on board, carrying with them
the murderous missive, there went with them one
who knew its purport, and who could be as speedy as
they and as silent as the grave to which the Ephors
were seeking to consign his friend and master.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fleet first made for Melos, some seventy
miles from Malea. On the way they fell in with
ten Athenian ships, and took three of them;
the rest escaped. Fearing that their voyage to
Miletos would thus be heard of by the Athenian
fleet at Samos, they steered for Krete, and thence
round by Kaunos, on the Karian coast. The
navigation from Kaunos to Miletos was dangerous
for a fleet of their small strength, with the
Athenians on the watch for them. So they determined
to send a message by some sailors in
a small boat to Astyochos, begging him to come
to convoy them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Agrestides volunteered to go on this perilous
adventure—perilous by reason of the storms to
which that coast is liable, and from Athenian
ships being on the look-out to prevent communication
between the admiral at Miletos and
his countrymen. And so, tossed about in a frail
boat, and still more agitated in his mind, we
must leave Agrestides for a little while.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c009'>In the pleasant isle of Samos there were many
and great misgivings amongst the Athenian
generals and the high-born, delicately nurtured,
intellectual Greeks who at this crisis were serving
under them. Sailors are generally conservative;
they were often known to be oligarchic, sometimes
even monarchic. The officers and many
of the men in the fleet at Samos were no exception
to this rule. Pressed to serve among them,
in this last extremity of their country, were not
only many of the ‘aristoi,’ the better sort, who
formed the bulk of the aristocracy, but some
even of the ‘beltistoi,’ the very best of all,
the very highest of that favoured class who
divide mankind—that is, the gentle portion of
mankind, the rest not counting into the good—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>is, the well-to-do and worthy citizens of
some estate, the better, and the best, in which
last class they place themselves.</p>
<p class='c010'>Somehow this self-complacent distinction has at
different times been adopted by various ranks and
classes, and the highest in the social scale have
been the most apt to consider themselves entitled
to have applied to them the predication of an
adjective, with its varying degrees of comparison,
which other simpler folk suppose should be kept
exclusively to denote an ascending scale of virtue.</p>

<p class='c010'>The high-born sailors who lay inactive all this
time at Samos had fallen into this convenient
way of classifying their compeers and themselves,
as their fathers had done before them.
They were of the good, the better, and the very
best, and they loved not the unclassed, the mere
‘hoi polloi,’ who actually ruled at Athens. They
had often wondered how a gentleman like Alkibiades,
who, they all admitted, was, by right of
birth, one of the beltistoi, could, even in name,
belong in politics to the party of that huge
collection of undistinguished, indistinguishable
human beings, ‘that balmy mass of puffed-up
froth’ which called itself the demos. His
ancestors certainly had set him the example;
his family had belonged to that side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>had led these ungovernable masses, and perhaps
that made a difference. There is something
conservative in doing as your ancestors have
done. He knew best. He was the cleverest
man in Greece, and ought to know. But for the
life of them they could not understand it. They
could not believe that he really cared for tailors,
and tinkers, and cobblers, and water-carriers, the
riff-raff of the town.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their hearts had yearned towards him when
they saw him at Miletos leading the poor Milesians
and beating the stupid Argives. Some had caught
sight of him one day on a Spartan trireme passing
by Samos, defying the Athenians to come out into
the open sea and fight. He stood there on the
high deck of the Spartan ship defying them
cheerily, dressed no better than a common Spartan.
They recalled a day, three years ago, when he
stood on his own good ship the <i>Eros</i>, with its
purple sails,—the god Eros wrought in silver upon
them, as it went proudly at the head of the fleet,
which they thought was going to subdue the world,
‘and would have done so, had they left him alone,
before his enemies brought those silly charges
against him in his absence, and the sillier demos
swallowed them.’ The <i>Eros</i> had been taken into
the service of the state—indeed, was there at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Samos,—though its purple sails and silver gods
of love had long been sacrificed to the necessities
of Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>These necessities were becoming serious. It
was very well for the Spartans to stay shut up at
Miletos or Rhodes. The Spartans were maintained
by the Persian satrap. Tissaphernes paid regularly
a whole drachma a day for every sailor in the
Spartan fleet. They had all the ports and rich
towns on the Ionian coast to victual in, ‘while
we have only Samos we can call our own, and three
oboloi a day per man, paid at long intervals,
and the gods alone know how long even that
pittance will last.’ So said the sailors. And,
indeed, an army of some thousands, with one
hundred and twenty triremes and their crews,
cannot be kept for nothing. Each day news was
expected from Athens that she could do no more,
that the last obolos of the reserve of the ten
thousand talents laid up by Perikles was gone,
and that they must shift for themselves in future.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides these many causes of complaint, the
sort of general the demos had sent out to them did
not tend to make them love the demos any better.
Phrynichos was universally distrusted and disliked.
Sprung from the lowest class of the
people, he had made his way upward by the basest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>means. He had been one of those, the most
odious of mankind, who gained a living by bringing
accusations against citizens to the dikasterion—sycophants
they were called at Athens. At all
times and places the office of delator has been
held in horror and contempt, though it has not
seldom raised those vile enough to adopt it as a
calling, to wealth and even civil dignity.</p>

<p class='c010'>This calling was little known in Greece, and in
that respect, democratic Athens shows its moral
superiority to imperial Rome. But Phrynichos
succeeded and grew rich. He grubbed together
enough money to make himself conspicuous, and
he had sufficient cunning to mislead the people.
Of genius or capacity to lead a senate or an
army, he had none, but he was great in intrigue.
Cunning is ever the mark of littleness of mind,
and generally ends by destroying the possessor
of that gift; so it was with Phrynichos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vague rumours, too, had reached the Athenians
at Samos from time to time of a huge fleet—of
three hundred sail, it was said—lying at Aspendos,
waiting the orders of the Great King to come into
Ionian waters to destroy them. They cared not
much for Persian ships or Persian sailors, but
three hundred long-ships added to the large fleet
the Spartans had already—what could even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Athenians do against such odds? It was all the
fault of this infernal demos; but for them there
would have been no quarrel with the Spartans.
Even the demos must see to what their rule had
brought the state, and any change would be
accepted rather than the starvation which now
threatened them. The demos, though it loves
shouting, haranguing, or listening at its Ekklesia,
does not love starvation. So something must
and should be done to change all this.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus thought and spake to one another the
well-to-do Athenian sailors, as they lay idling
away their time, after the manner of sailors, in
the fair port of Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not far off, at Miletos, on one of these evenings,
Alkibiades was supping in the frugal Spartan
fashion with his friend Astyochos, High Admiral
of the Spartan fleet, when they were suddenly
interrupted in their conversation by a messenger
who had just arrived from Kaunus, bearing an
urgent despatch from the commissioners of Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two friends were talking of their future
plans and movements, both complaining of the
delay which kept them there in idleness, wondering
when help would be sent from Lakedaimôn,
and if the Persian fleet would ever really come
to their assistance, and what it would be like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>when it did come. They had heard that commissioners
were to be sent from Sparta. Astyochos
asked what on earth commissioners were to
be sent for; he cursed the commissioners and
their interference, and the changes in his
well-laid plans which these men, ignorant of
warfare, would be sure to make. As soon, however,
as Astyochos had glanced at the message
which was thus suddenly given to him, he bade
his friend good-night, for next day early, he said,
he would have to start for Kaunus with the fleet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades went back to his lodgings in the
town. On his way a stranger met him, and
followed him along the street and into his room.
The Athenian turned round hastily upon him and
grasped a weapon. They stood face to face.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stranger removed a weather-beaten sailor’s
cap—there was Agrestides. The exclamation of
surprise that Alkibiades was about to make was
stopped by the strange and agitated look of the
newcomer. They sat down upon the plain, hard
couch. Agrestides, trembling with emotion, told
the message of warning which Endios had given
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He noticed the hard smile upon the face of
perfect beauty. It came for a moment and was
gone.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The open-hearted sailor, for all his knowledge
of his master, could not help feeling astonishment
at the cool reception of the news which
he had brought, the terrible nature and effect
of which had not been absent from his mind
by day or night since it had been entrusted to
him at Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Get you as swift a horse as you can find at
once. Meet me outside the eastern gate in half
an hour. Let no one think that you have seen
me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Agrestides went out. Alkibiades put on a
Spartan sailor’s dress, got his horse himself, and
in less time than he had mentioned was out of
Miletos by the eastern postern.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agrestides was there before him. They went for
some distance in an easterly direction, and then,
turning sharply to the south, struck the road to
Teichioussa. They rode in silence through the
night. Alkibiades knew the road. He had lately
been that way when he saved Miletos for the
Spartans. Before dawn they were at Teichioussa.
There he found some Persians he knew, and learnt
from them that Tissaphernes was at Magnesia.
After a short rest he got fresh horses and a
Persian robe, and the two set out again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the past night’s ride along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>solitary road Alkibiades had spoken no word.
His companion could not see his face. There
was that within him for which no words of human
language have been found. For all his faults—and
by this time those who have followed his
career thus far may perhaps think he had some,—there
lay beneath them all a well of generosity.
Among the varying qualities which went to make
up that mixture of divergent sentiments which
we call his character was an overwhelming, innate
love of justice. When that was outraged, there
arose within him the deadliest and most enduring
desire for revenge. He enjoyed life enormously,
and had that keen pleasure in the mere consciousness
of being, which others, less gifted,
cannot imagine, and he wished that all other
men should enjoy their lives. He loved his ease,
his happiness, his indulgences; he wished that
others should be happy; the idea of happiness
was, for the most part at that time, confused
with pleasure and indulgence. But above all this
there was a loathing of, a nervous shrinking from,
anything which in any way could be regarded
by anyone as a taint of cowardice. ‘I would
rather die than be a coward,’ he had once said to
Sokrates while he was an ardent, dreamy boy.
These are nearly the first words we find recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>of him. When he once saw another boy of nearly
twice his size taking by force a smaller boy’s playthings
from him, he rushed at him in such fury
that he had thrashed and smashed him before the
bully had recovered from his astonishment. It
was this generous love of right as much as his
extraordinary gifts of intellect and beauty and
excellence in all manly exercises which had
made him an uncrowned king among the boys
of Athens, and would have left him king of men
throughout his life had not the spirit of injustice
been too strong for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now, as he rode silently through the dark
night to Teichioussa, his wrongs came over him in
their intense reality. It was only the old determination
still—to die rather than be, or be thought
to be, a coward—which prevented their weight
from overpowering him. It was not vindictiveness.
You may call it pride, vanity, spirit
of revenge, or what you will, but it was rather a
burning sense of wrong, whenever he found that
wrong was being done, and a determination to set
it right; a determination to be stopped by nothing
till he should have conquered the injustice, at
whatever cost; a stubborn resolve to set himself
right in the eyes of men—this is what has been
mistaken in him for vindictiveness, and by those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>who have not read his character below the surface,
for selfishness and vanity. In fact, when
a great deed was to be done, however much it
clashed with self-interest and vanity, no one
showed a greater disregard of self than he did.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a sense this was in itself a species of pride
or even vanity. He had his share of both. In
what great human action is there no admixture
of vanity? Is there, or has there ever been, a
man who, when doing the most unselfish, self-denying,
humble work of charity, has not some
far-hidden and scarcely conscious sense of behaving
rather better than some others would
have done? Has there ever been anyone who
would devote his whole existence to alleviate the
sufferings of others if he were quite certain that
no one would ever know what he had done, and
that he would never get any possible reward, of
any sort, for doing it?</p>

<p class='c010'>We are not defending him in all he did. We only
seek impartially to analyze the feelings which
had moved him in the past, and were now again
to do so, and to rescue his memory from the injustice
that has been done him by those who
imagine him to have been a mere voluptuary,
and who, not able to understand his character,
mistake his apparent carelessness for flippancy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and are led away by contemporary writers whose
personal hostility to him has made them seek to
depreciate, and even to distort, where they cannot
deny, the heroic actions which they are forced to
admit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Against his natural inclinations and sympathies
he had adopted the side of the populace at
Athens. Having chosen it, he fought repeatedly
for them, and would have gone on fighting for
them, had they been true to him, as he would
have served his country’s cause for ever if it had
let him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had advised a war against a power which
was domineering over smaller states and cities
allied with his country in Sicily. If he had been
allowed to finish the war which he had strongly
advised and prosperously begun, it would, as far
as we can see, have redounded to the honour and
glory of his country. He had given his whole
energy to the conduct of the war; he was, he
believed, about to bring it, in spite of the difficulties
in his way, to a successful end. He was
recalled while striving for this object, and doomed,
without a spark of evidence worthy of a sane
man’s belief, upon a silly, trumped-up tale, to die
a shameful, a malefactor’s death. He knew he
had been cursed by an interested hierarchy. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>knew a stone had been set up in Athens recording
his sentence and disgrace. The thought of
that stone lie was never absent from his mind
through all the weary time he lived at Sparta.
Thenceforward, while that stone stood there,
there never passed a day without a renewal of
his vow that it should be cast down by the will
and deed of those who had set it up, that the
same voices which had ordered the lie to be
engraved upon it should order its obliteration,
and that the tongues which cursed him should
recall their curse. Any other life but one
devoted to this end and object would have
appeared to him a life of cowardice. He declined
to live in that condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then when, in order to gain this end of his
existence and to teach a salutary lesson to the
workers of injustice, he had sought the help of
Spartan enemies of Athens, and had promised to
spare nothing in their cause, and they had accepted
his assistance and made use of him, he kept his
word to Sparta. How well he kept it she knew, and
so did Athens. He would have kept it to the end,
as throughout his eventful life he was ever true
to whatever he had promised or had undertaken.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had counselled the Spartan oligarchy, and
told them what would come to pass if his advice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>was taken. They took his counsel; every word
came true. His influence and power had gained
for them the allies he had detached from Athens.
Day and night he thought and worked, and fought
and won, for his new associates. In the midst
of his, and their, success came this second blow,
as that other one had come before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps we can grow accustomed to the hardest
fortune by degrees. Succeeding sorrows, though
on less grievous, seem to affect us less than the
first great sorrow did. We do not grow callous,
but we seem to get accustomed to them. This
second stab was not felt so keenly as that other;
at all events, it was not from his own people that
it came. His vengeance, or rather the vindication
of his fame from a suspicion that he could live
without punishing this Spartan evil-doing, was
no less startling and complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the long dark ride a nightmare of
oppression had hung over him. He tried to shake
it off; it came again, heavier and more oppressive.
Had he no friends, no one on whom he
could rely? Were all mankind alike—all unjust,
all plotting for his death, all, especially those he
deserved most thanks from, banded together for
his destruction? His mind was in a state of
high excitement and exaltation, by the time he got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to Teichioussa. During their short stay there he
had not slept, he had not rested; the nightmare
was still on him, pressing the life out of him,
just as the Spartan commissioners, or perhaps his
friend Astyochos, or some purchased assassin,
would have done, if they could have caught
him at Miletos.</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose to rid himself of this intolerable burden.
He roused Agrestides; he had almost forgotten
Agrestides and gone off without him. The honest
sailor’s face cheered him as he looked at him for
a moment, fast asleep, worn out by bodily fatigue.
He woke him. Agrestides sat up and gazed
round, half awake. He saw by the worn face of
Alkibiades that he was suffering. A tear fell
down the rough man’s cheek. His master noticed
it, comprehended what it meant. All mankind,
then, were not in league against him; there was
at least this one who was true. There might be
many others that he knew not of.</p>

<p class='c010'>So they journeyed together. First, along the
valley which they had passed through the night
before, on to the reach of sea not far eastward
of Miletos, then to the winding banks of the
Maiandros, and through the rich and pleasant
land by which it flows. Agrestides told all he
knew of the conspiracy, and how he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>sent by Endios to warn Alkibiades of his fate
and frustrate his enemies’ designs. Alkibiades
had forgotten Endios. There was then another
faithful friend that he could count upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had put off the Spartan sailor’s dress, and
wore a Persian robe of some magnificence which
he had obtained at Teichioussa. His spirits rose
again as he went on. With the bright, genial
sunshine he had come out of the dark horror of
the past night, and was living in the future, cheered
by the new plans that he was already forming,
with a double purpose—to get back in honour to
his country and to punish Sparta.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>As</span> they drew near Magnesia they were struck
with the beauty and splendour of the place,
differing so greatly from the magnificence of
Athens or any other place they had seen. There
was little architectural art in the form of temples
or of statues. Art here was found chiefly in the
beauty of the gardens, in directing Nature, and
in adding to man’s luxury and comfort. As they
reached the dwelling of the satrap, they were
astonished at the vastness of the grounds through
which they rode, the trees, the flowering shrubs,
the roses, the citrons, and the myrtles. At length
they reached the palace. Servants in gay Eastern
dresses, bright with many colours, were about the
doors, the courts and the arcades, some actively engaged
in preparing for the banquet, others lounging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>about or squatting on the ground as though they
had nothing else to do in life but to enjoy its
sunshine, till a court-official came with whip in
hand to set the lazy dogs to work.</p>
<p class='c010'>The Nubian porter was surprised at the appearance
of the travellers. The commanding presence
of one of them increased his wonder. When he
saw the eager joy with which his lord and master,
the mighty satrap, embraced him, his surprise
was great indeed. The slaves had never heard
of Alkibiades. They looked upon the Greeks
as pale islanders who had settled on the coast,
protected by the satrap of the King of Kings, and
allowed by him to live as long as they paid tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reception by Tissaphernes was as warm
and cordial as could be. After the traveller had
refreshed himself by rest and a luxurious bath,
such as he had not been able to enjoy for many
a day, a banquet of more than usual splendour
was given in honour of the Athenian.</p>

<p class='c010'>He soon became the inseparable companion of
the satrap, for there was a joyaunce in his whole
demeanour, something peculiar and loveable about
him, a gaiety and sprightliness in all he said and
did, that relieved the monotony of life, and shed
a lustre round it day by day; a spaciousness
and beauty in his graver thoughts, a brightness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>even in the small, familiar opinions he expressed,
on men and manners, that made all listen to
him when he spoke; while there was a grace
and beauty in his countenance which brightened
and adorned everything about him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He who lately had made the Spartans wonder
at the hardness and simplicity of his life now
astonished the effeminate Persians by the softness,
gentleness, even the effeminacy, of his
ways. He adopted all their habits, and amongst
those luxurious Easterns none was more splendidly
luxurious than he, or a more joyous companion
in the pleasures and the pastimes of the satrap’s
court. But when the viceregal hunt took place in
the vast Magnesian “paradise,” the supple Greek
threw off, for the time, his newly-assumed soft,
dallying ways, and showed how his horse was
fleetest in pursuit of deer, his spear of surest aim
when the wild boar came across his path. And
when high matters of state had to be considered,
there was no counsellor so wise, none whose
judgment was so luminous, or on whose sage
diplomacy his friend and host could so implicitly
rely. In a short time he gained a complete
ascendancy in the councils of the Persian, who
entered on no course of action save by the guidance
of his constant companion and incomparable friend.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Alkibiades began by suggesting that perhaps
it was not wise to let the Lakedaimonians become
too strong. Athens, he said, was well-nigh
crushed in Greece. Sparta had Athens in her
power by land; if she was aided further by the
Persian fleet and Persian money, she would gain
complete mastery by sea, become too strong, be
puffed up with pride and insolence, and kick
against the terms of her treaty with the Persian
king. The Spartans were a people of proverbially
bad faith. It was better that these two powers
should balance one another than that either should
preponderate. It was the best course to let them
go on destroying one another. Then Persia would
gain an ascendancy in Ionia and in the Aigaian
Sea. On the other hand, if it should happen
that Athens ever did become a tributary state to
Sparta, which now seemed not impossible, the
Persians would have at great expense and loss
to combat the successful state, in order to keep
it within reasonable limits. These arguments
had no little weight with Tissaphernes.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What, then, do you advise?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Keep back your fleet indefinitely. Reduce
your payments to the Spartans. Pay them no
more than three obols a day, and do not pay
that too regularly.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>‘But if the Spartans threaten to break off the
alliance before Athens is sufficiently weakened?’
objected Tissaphernes.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Point out to them that the Athenians allow
their sailors but three obols, that the war has
already lasted so long without result that it is impossible
to go on paying the subsidy much longer.
And the Spartan admirals and high officials are
not above taking a small bribe—pay them, and
they will not complain too loudly of the reduction
of the payment to their men. Treat the towns
and islands that have thrown off their allegiance
to Athens in the same way—forget to pay the
subsidy that you have promised.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This advice was taken. It not only had the
appearance of sound policy, but it happened to
agree with the interests of Tissaphernes, who,
like some others, would rather spend the money
he squeezed out of the subjects of the king on
his own delights and favourites than squander it
in paying subsidies to other nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the end of the next month the drachma a
day for each man in the Spartan fleet remained
unpaid, nor could their leaders get a satisfactory
answer to their importunities. At length some of
the high commissioners came to demand, rather
indignantly, the fulfilment of the treaty. Tissaphernes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>received them courteously, and promised
to put their grievances before the great king his
master, and do his best to get the Persian fleet
to come as soon as possible to their assistance.
He assured them it would not be long before the
order was given, and in the meantime he counselled
them not to engage the Athenians at sea.
As to the non-payment of the subsidy, he promised
that something should be given at once, and a
private douceur to each of the commissioners
softened their feelings with regard to the ill-paid
sailors. They returned to Rhodes and laid up the
chief part of their fleet there for the present. It
remained laid up all the autumn and the winter,
a respite of incalculable benefit to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the revolted Ionian towns came to complain
that the pecuniary assistance promised
them when they forsook the Athenian alliance
was not paid, they were received in audience
by Alkibiades, who seemed to manage everything
now for Tissaphernes.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What!’ said he to those from Chios in a tone
of anger. ‘You, the richest of the Greek islands,
you who owe your freedom from the yoke of
Athens to the Persians, you ask for money from
them! Before you revolted, how much had you
to pay to Athens? Ought you not to make as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>great, or greater, sacrifices now when it concerns
your liberty?’</p>

<p class='c010'>They went away dissatisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Samos the feeling we lately saw growing
amongst the Athenians there was daily becoming
more acute. Both army and navy were verging
on an open demonstration against the government
at home. Alkibiades, never idle, in the
midst of his apparent indolence, was not ignorant
of the movement. And so it happened that one
day, towards the end of the autumn of 412, a
sailor named Agrestides landed at Samos. He
was not long in making friends among the Athenian
sailors who swarmed about Samos doing nothing.
They met in the wine-shops, on the quays, in
many places. Agrestides had been in the Sicilian
expedition, and had escaped, he said, after the
fatal fight at Syrakuse, when the whole fleet
with almost all the Athenian sailors was lost.
He had been picked up by a Carthaginian vessel,
and after many wanderings and adventures had
found himself at Sparta, where he had passed as
a Messanian; thence, he told them, he had got on
board a Spartan ship and had gone with certain
Spartan commissioners to Kaunos, and so on to
Miletos. While there he had met his old general,
Alkibiades, who was, he heard, greater than ever,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and was now governing, in the satrap’s name, all
the Ionian possessions of the Persian king.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Having listened to this not improbable romance,
they wanted to know more about Sicily and the
fatal expedition, for then they would hear more
about Alkibiades. Alkibiades was the hero of
the fleet at Samos. They all wanted to hear of
him. Even while he had been dealing the
deadliest blows at them through Sparta, the
Athenians had felt a sort of pride in him. It
was not so much Lakedaimôn that was fighting
them as it was one of themselves, justly incensed at
the wrong the misled demos had done him, who
was punishing them. And when Lakedaimôn
in turn found he was too great for them, it was
he, an Athenian, who was managing Tissaphernes,
and leading Lakedaimôn such a dance as she
had little bargained for.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agrestides, having made due observation, got
himself taken to Peisandros and some others of the
leaders, who he discovered would be the most fit
to receive his overtures. When he was convinced
of their sincerity he told them that he had come
from his great master, who was longing to get
back amongst his countrymen again.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was, indeed, good news for them. It
was soon settled that Peisandros and two others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>should return with Agrestides to Magnesia. When
they got there they found he had not exaggerated
that part of his story in which he had told them
of his master’s influence with Tissaphernes. The
heart of Alkibiades yearned towards his countrymen
when he saw them coming, as messengers
from the Athenian forces at Samos, to make
overtures to him. He felt as a brother meeting
his brethren after a long absence among strangers
in a distant land. All the magnificence, the soft
allurements of his eastern life, seemed but the
toys of children to him, as a long vista opened
up before him, with home and Athens and honour
at the end of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But no one knew better how to be practical
when it was necessary so to be. He had been
acquainted with Peisandros in old days—a man
of some ability and power of speech, not to be
trusted too far, and of doubtful courage. Alkibiades
saw the difficulty the oligarchic deputation
felt. He went before it, met it boldly and in
diplomatic fashion. He told them frankly of
his influence in the councils of the Persian, and
of his efforts to break up the alliance between
Sparta and Persia; that he had delayed the coming
of the Persian fleet, and had stopped the Persian
subsidies; that it was through his advice the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>Spartan fleet was now laid up inactively at Rhodes;
and that he was at work endeavouring to bring
about a Persian-Athenian alliance. ‘But,’ he added
truthfully, ‘there is one thing I cannot do, there is
one point on which the Minister of the king stands
firm: he will not even enter into negotiations for a
treaty with a democratic government; much less
could I persuade him to make alliance with one.
He distrusts the people; he says they will one thing
to-day and another thing to-morrow. And even
if I could overcome the objections of Tissaphernes
to a democracy, neither he nor I could induce the
Persian king to treat with any but a kingly government,
or at least an aristocracy. These things
would have been hard for me to say or hear at one
time, but,’ he added sadly, ‘I, too, have been
taught to distrust the justice of the people.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing could have been more welcome to
Peisandros and the other Athenian deputies
from Samos. This was the one thing they wanted,
the one thing they feared it would be impossible
to get. With Alkibiades friendly to an oligarchy,
all difficulties vanished. The very condition they
shrank from mentioning to him he had insisted
on himself. He had smoothed the way. All
was plain sailing now, they thought, at Samos,
except for that miscreant Phrynichos; they only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>doubted about him. They knew his inveterate
hatred of Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as they got back to Samos they called
together their friends, the chiefs of the oligarchic
party there. Nearly all the leaders were oligarchic.
Phrynichos, of course, was oligarchic. They told
the happy outcome of their mission; all were
delighted except that one. He avowed his
scepticism. He knew the steadfast nature of
Alkibiades too well to believe that he seriously
intended to join himself to the enemies of the
people, however little the people deserved his
staunch fidelity. However much the people had
injured him, the oligarchs had hurt him more.
Phrynichos remembered how in years gone by
they had tried to attract him to their side; he
more than suspected that the old charges brought
against Alkibiades had been due to the vengeance
of that party, whose proposals he had scorned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Passing by the doubts of Phrynichos as unworthy
of consideration, Peisandros and his
colleagues announced to the sailors and hoplites
the joyful news that the great king was about to
desert their enemies and make a grand alliance
with them and pay them an enormous subsidy, and
that Alkibiades was to be recalled. The people
could not be restrained on hearing it. As each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>item of the news was told it was difficult to keep
them still enough to listen to the next. It was
almost too good to be true. When they came to
the recall of Alkibiades their generous emotion
overcame them; many a hard sailor’s face was
moist with tears. Most of these common sailors,
indeed, showed some dismay when, at the end,
Peisandros told them of the one condition—that
the democracy must be abolished, or at least
greatly modified, for a time. ‘But, after all,
what mattered the form of government,’ they
began to think, ‘if they could but be extricated
from their present dangers, and the great Alkibiades
be back again to manage everything?
He was the wisest. If he did not mind the change,
who need care? He must be right.’</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then resolved amongst the chiefs to send
Peisandros and ten other deputies to Athens
to prepare the way for a peaceful revolution.
The deputies set off upon their mission, not unaware
of the strength of the prejudices they would
have to overcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>Phrynichos was trembling with rage and terror;
his cunning was not allowed to sleep. He determined
to destroy Alkibiades by the hand of
Astyochos, and scrupled not, in order to carry out
his intended murder, to betray secrets of the state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>which had come to his knowledge as strategos,
to this country’s enemy. He wrote privately
to the Spartan admiral at Miletos, telling him
who it was that was stopping the Persian payment
of the Spartan fleet, and was endeavouring
to dissolve the alliance between Persia and
Lakedaimôn, and to bring about a treaty between
the Persian king and Athens, and advised him
to get rid, by any practicable means, of such a
dangerous enemy as Alkibiades had become.</p>

<p class='c010'>Astyochos, who, like every other honest man
who knew him, loved his old friend and comrade,
refused to take advantage of this odious treachery,
by which Phrynichos, while entrusted with his
country’s interests, was doing all he could to
stop the services Alkibiades was rendering to
Athens. He sent the treacherous letter on to
Alkibiades. Alkibiades in turn sent it back to
the other leaders at Samos, and so convicted
Phrynichos. The soldiers when they heard of
the base deed would have slain their general then
and there but for their inbred Athenian respect
for the due formalities of law. The criminal
was reserved for future trial by the proper courts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cup of this man’s iniquity was not full, nor
his cunning nearly exhausted. By a piece of
trickery, so subtle that we can hardly help feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>some sort of admiration for it, he wrote again to
the Lakedaimonian admiral betraying the weak
point of the defence of Samos, and offering to
help him whenever he should invade the island,
and gently complaining that his first letter had,
by some accident, found its way into the hands
of Alkibiades. Then, knowing that Astyochos
would do with this overture as he had done with
the other, and that it would soon come back to
Samos, even as that other one had come, he
advised his brother generals to strengthen with
new forts the spot which he had suggested to
Astyochos as the weak point of resistance.
Astyochos refused to take advantage of this
further apparent act of treason, and made it
known to Alkibiades, who, as had been foreseen
by the fox-like Phrynichos, straightway informed
the Athenian generals at Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The culprit, called upon for his defence to this
second charge, declared that both were base
calumnies got up by his enemy to ruin him, and he
pointed to the fact that he had himself advised the
fortifying of the very place he was now absurdly
charged with betraying to the Spartans as the
weak spot for their attack. This answer seemed
conclusive, and, for a time, both charges were
allowed to drop.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>As</span> soon as Peisandros and the other envoys were
arrived at Athens the people assembled in their
Ekklesia to hear and discuss the news from
Samos. Peisandros began by moving for the
recall of Phrynichos on account of incompetence
and cowardice, and gave such good reasons for
his motion that it was carried without difficulty.
He then laid before them the business that had
brought him there, and the result of his mission
to the court of Tissaphernes. His task, as may
well be imagined, was not an easy one—to propose
before an assembly of the people the
abolition of their power and existence as a
governing power, and that people the Athenian
demos.</p>
<p class='c010'>His proposal, put in many ways, and with great
tact, was the recall of Alkibiades, the government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>of the few, and an alliance with Persia which
would give them the victory over Sparta.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a hubbub, such an outcry, as followed this
address has seldom come from human lungs or from
human throats. One after another the champions
of the people rose, with the one answer, supported
by six thousand voices, ‘Never!’ The orators
declared the democracy eternal. The enemies of
Alkibiades protested against the enormity of recalling
one who had been convicted of the worst
possible offence against the laws of Athens, one
who was still civilly dead. The Eumolpidai, the
privileged priests of the cult of Demeter, who felt,
perhaps, as strongly for their exclusive rights and
emoluments as for the honour of the goddess,
reminded the assembly of the awful curses which
still rested on him for his profanation of the
mysteries of which they were the guardians, and
which he had treated with derision and contempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the opponents of his proposition had
expended all their wrath, Peisandros rose again
to answer them.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Of what use is it to preserve the mere form
and semblance of a constitution when the spirit
of the thing is gone, and the state is tottering?
Is it not better to modify somewhat your existing
laws than to lose them altogether, and with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>your power of making others? We ask only
that you will let your democratic forms be in
abeyance while we treat with the Great King.
He is ready to come to your assistance if you
will meet him in a reasonable spirit. Let, then,
the power of the many for a time be entrusted
to the keeping of your wisest counsellors, chosen
by yourselves, men whom all of you can trust;
and when the clouds, which now are big and
bursting with destruction, shall have passed
away, you can have back again your glorious and
time-honoured constitution. There is but one
man who can save you in this hour of need; he
is a lover of the people: that man is Alkibiades.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The force of this argument, and the apparent
truth of these assertions, had so much influence
on the assembly that objectors were silenced,
and the people took the first step towards the
abdication of their power, though they were not
prepared to make so violent a change as that
which had been just suggested to them all at
once. They decreed that ten deputies should
be sent with Peisandros to Tissaphernes to arrange
the best terms on which an alliance with Persia
might be carried out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Peisandros left for Asia, he resorted
to other devices to further his designs on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>democracy, of which he had hitherto put himself
forward as a firm supporter. He set the secret clubs
in motion. The secret clubs in Athens, chiefly of
the oligarchic faction, were of immense political
importance. It was by them that the work of party
intrigue was carried on. At no time in history,
not even during the French Revolution, have
secret clubs been better managed for this purpose
than they were at this time in Athens, nor did they
ever work together in more perfect order. While
the democracy was unbroken and Athens flourished
they dared not show themselves or their doings too
openly. The time was now come for their hidden
power to manifest itself. Their members need
now hesitate at no crimes which might advance
their political designs. Crimes might be done
by them and be forever undiscovered, and so
committed with impunity. Having set these
secret societies to work, Peisandros left, with the
ten deputies, for the court of Tissaphernes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades had found the full length to which
he could go with his friend the satrap, or, which
was nearly the same thing, the amount of
power the satrap had independently of the king.
Stopping the pay of Spartan sailors was all
very well: it saved the Persian’s purse. Keeping
his master’s fleet in safety and idleness at Aspendos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>was better than furnishing it with its full complement
of men and arms, and letting it be knocked
about by the Athenian sailors. But an alliance
out and out with Athens was different altogether.
It meant parting with the Spartans finally, and
all real chance of recovering dominion over the
islands and coast towns of Ionia. The king
was not under the spell of the favourite of Tissaphernes.
He never would believe that the
Athenians intended to give up a dominion they
had bought at so great a cost and had exercised
so long. Tissaphernes knew his master would
decline the Athenian alliance, even when urged
with the same arguments which his friend had
used with so much force on him. So he was forced
to tell his guest, with much regret, that there
were difficulties in the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>But neither was Alkibiades willing that all
the terms of the propounded treaty should be
accepted. He distrusted Peisandros, and despised
the wretched Phrynichos. He did not believe
in an oligarchic government for Athens. Much
as he longed to get back home again, he would
not go there but with honour. Little as the
people deserved his care and sympathy, he
declined to inflict further punishment upon them.
We shall see how—like another exile who, seventeen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>hundred years afterwards, rejected the desire
of his soul, and refused to return to his beloved
birthplace upon conditions which he deemed
unworthy of him—he nobly refused the great
object of his life, rather than obtain it to his
country’s detriment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such was the condition of affairs when Peisandros
arrived for a second time at Magnesia
with his ten colleagues.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades, rather weary of the effeminate life
at the palace of the satrap, had been staying at
a small country house which his indulgent friend
had given him, in a secluded spot, far from the
turmoil of the court, and some way inland, not
far from the marble quarries at Melissa. Thither
Tissaphernes had come in search of his friend, and
had forced him to return with him to Magnesia.
It was while staying there, and on the journey
back, that he sounded the viceroy as to the limit
of his powers, and made up his mind as to the
answer he must give the Athenian envoys on his
return. He undertook to receive the deputation
in the presence of his host.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seeing that the treaty could not be carried
out with honour to Athens, and refusing to have
anything to do with it on any other terms, he
insisted on conditions with the deputies which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>he knew they must reject. Peisandros lost
patience, broke off the conference, and returned
to Samos. There he declared amongst his friends
and partisans that his belief was that Alkibiades
had never really wished to aid the oligarchic rising,
and that he was using his power with the satrap
to destroy the oligarchic party. This bad news
roused the clique to energy; they determined
to act without him, and to invite their friends
at Athens to do the same. For this purpose
Peisandros set out with the ten deputies for
Athens, recruiting a force of fighting men to help
them on the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the amazement of Peisandros and his friends,
when at last they reached Athens, they found the
engine he had set to work had acted with a success
beyond his expectations. The democracy as a
governing body had disappeared. It was as
though the earth had gaped and swallowed up
its mountains, towns, and rivers. The face of
everything was changed. Loathsome animalcules,
crawling and breeding underground, waiting for
a sign of weakness in the body politic, seeing
their time was come, had risen to the surface of
the soil and seized upon their victim. In her
robust and healthy state they might have swarmed
about her harmless till they were crushed or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>sent back to the dirt from which they had emerged.
But the demos tottered from the moment it first
listened to a possibility of compromise. When
it allowed the suggestion of an abdication to go
unpunished, the process of its abdication was
begun. Assassins pounced upon the few strong
men left, and disappeared in darkness, no one
knew where. The rest were too frightened to
inquire. Daggers grew bolder, and struck right
and left. Panic set in. Men dared not to speak
their thoughts. They knew not who was or
was not in the plot.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the minds of weak men had been reduced
to the required point of fear, the skulking conspirators,
with Phrynichos at their head, and a
professional rhetorician named Antiphon, came
out, and by one final blow abolished, with the
people’s trembling consent, the power of the
people. They elected in its place a government
of four hundred subservient tools, chosen beforehand
by themselves. This was the new régime
Peisandros found when he came back to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very different events were taking place at
Samos. For a short time the oligarchic faction
there attempted the same plan of action, and
slew poor Hyperbolos, the potter. Poor Hyperbolos!
One always feels inclined to laugh when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>his name is mentioned. Yet there must have
been something in him. He rose above the
common level both at home and at Samos. But
his name sounds so absurd by the side of those
great ones who had been ostracized before him
that we can hardly help a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hoplites stationed at Samos did not smile.
They had a short time back listened for a moment
to Peisandros, when he talked eloquently to them
of the necessity of modifying somewhat their old
form of government; but they never liked the
notion of the change, and only tolerated it on
the condition that Alkibiades was to come back
to them, with or without the Persian fleet and
Persian gold. It was the man they wanted more
than the help of barbarous Persians.</p>

<p class='c010'>The healthy democrats of Samos did not long
suffer oligarchic daggers to be used on them.
Luckily two of the generals of the Athenian army
there were democratic. The stirring times called
forth two other men, of whom we shall hear a
good deal before long—Thrasyboulos, captain of
a trireme, and Thrasyllos, now only a soldier
serving in the ranks.</p>

<p class='c010'>News of the attempted rising and its speedy
overthrow was sent off to Athens by the <i>Paralos</i>,
the other sacred state trireme, whose sturdy crew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>had given invaluable help in quelling the abortive
Samian revolution. It was supposed that this
good news would be joyously received at the
Peiræus. One can imagine the astonishment of
Chaireas, the captain, and the crew of the sacred
ship, when they saw the change which had come
over Athens, and found that they were, almost as
prisoners, taken from the <i>Paralos</i> and sent off
on board another vessel to Euboia. Chaireas
alone escaped, and after hiding at Athens for
some time made his way back to Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>There he painted before his fellow-countrymen
in vivid, highly-coloured pictures the state of
things at home, and how it had been brought
about: the miserable condition of the people;
the savage triumph of the oligarchs; no assembly
of the people now, no tribunals to which the
injured could appeal. The traitors, he said,
were even making overtures to Sparta to come
and sustain them in their power on the ruins of
the state.</p>

<p class='c010'>On hearing this, the soldiers could hardly be
prevented from rushing on any whom they suspected
of having been in the late plot. They
were only restrained by some with cooler heads,
who pointed out the danger of fighting among
themselves while Sparta’s fleet was but a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>miles off at Miletos, ready to come down upon
them and destroy both parties. They had good
reason to be united and to respect themselves.
Athens gone, who was there left to carry on
Athenian institutions but this band of Athenians
at Samos? Athens was there.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thrasyllos and Thrasyboulos came forward
and impressed upon them the responsibilities
they lay under. By keeping united, by firmness
and good faith, they might restore order and right
at home, and make such examples of the traitors
as would be a warning to all others who might
in the future contemplate like treason.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘You have here—indeed, you are yourselves—the
chief part of all the force now left to our
ill-fated land. Here is a strong town from which
you can issue to attack the enemy, and to which
you can retire at need. Athens has little left now
but you. Expect no further aid from her. Rely
upon yourselves. Continue the war. And if the
worst should happen, you have ships to carry you
to some place where you will not want for fields
to till, nor towns to live in, and where you may
found a new and happier Athens beyond the seas.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The soldiers rose and swore a solemn oath to
act together, and never to separate till they had
done their duty to their old country. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the suspected leaders they deposed. Thrasyboulos
and Thrasyllos were chosen in their place.
The soldiers were animated by a new confidence in
one another, and in their mission, ready to live
and die in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to make sure against their twofold enemy
a strong general was wanted, and they felt, too,
that if aid could be obtained on honest terms from
Persia, they would be more than a match for
Sparta. In this state of feeling they met again
a few days afterwards. Thrasyboulos boldly
advised that Alkibiades should be invited to
come to Samos, and be invested with supreme
command. The proposal was received with acclamation,
and Thrasyboulos himself went off to the
Court of Tissaphernes with the invitation. He
found the great Athenian still at Magnesia amid
his eastern pleasures, with the satrap as much
under his influence as ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades at first supposed it was on some
fresh quest for Persian help that this new deputy
was come. When he heard what the message
was his heart bounded; he could scarce conceal
his feelings. To be free from the clogging atmosphere
of Asia, the cloying, enervating, unworthy
life; to breathe again among free men;
to have fresh opportunities of action—here was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>at last one step on towards his end, the end
of these long years of effort and of disappointment.
He broke the news to the regretful
Tissaphernes, and set out with his new-found
friend, with whom he was soon to do so much
for Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The troops and sailors and all the people were
looking out for him at Samos. As the triremes
came out to meet and welcome him on the bright
May day on which he reached the port, he could
almost imagine that his long exile was already
ended. An assembly of Athenians was speedily
called together. Alkibiades stood up before them;
but what could he say to them? His usual clear,
incisive sentences were broken by his unconcealed
emotion. He could not but be affected when
standing once more before his countrymen, after
his long and weary wanderings. It was a foretaste
of another great assembly, in another place, to
which he knew he would be recalled some day,
and in which he would be received with even
greater shouts and gratulations by the people.</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke to them at first a little of his wanderings
and sufferings. But this, he said, was not
a time for speaking of the past. It was as active
men, prepared to meet with many difficulties
and a dangerous future, that he met them there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>that day. He spoke with courage and with the
certitude of final triumph. Whatever he could do
to aid them with his right arm, or his counsel, they
might claim from him. Whatever influence he had
with Persia, through the Ionian satrap, he would
use to its utmost on their behalf. He told them
of his great friendship with the satrap, and how
that potent Minister of the Persian king had
promised to assist them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The story of what he had undergone through
the unjust suspicions of his countrymen, excited
by the slanders of his enemies, moved all who
heard him. His self-reliance, his ability, cheered
and encouraged them. His assurance of Persian
aid raised their hopes to the highest pitch of
expectation. They chose him with one voice
commander of the Athenian forces, with absolute
power to deal with friends and foes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>There</span> was plenty of work to do at Samos all that
summer—defences to be made secure, old ships
to be repaired and new ones built, military exercises
to be gone through day by day. There were
constant alarms to keep them on the alert. The
Spartan fleet, which had been laid up for the most
part at Rhodes through the past winter, pending
the arrival of the long-promised armament from
Persia, had been launched again, and taken in
state to Miletos, where it stood threatening those
at Samos. A Lakedaimonian general, they heard,
had marched north towards the Hellespont, and
was engaged in stirring up the cities on the way
which were still faithful to the Athenian alliance.
Abydos and Lampsakos had already thrown off
the yoke. Spartan emissaries were at Byzantion,
and in treaty with Pharnabazos, satrap of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Propontis, who, three years ago, had made offers
of alliance to Sparta.</p>
<p class='c010'>Then appalling news came that Tissaphernes
was again negotiating with the Lakedaimonian
commissioners. It was reported that he had
actually concluded a fresh treaty with them, by
which he pledged himself to renew his promised
pay, and bring that wonderful fleet at last
from Aspendos, that much-desired aid which
was always coming, but which never came.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as Alkibiades was elected general,
he determined to go and see for himself what
his Persian friend was doing. He knew the
weakness of the Viceroy’s character—how easily,
in his absence, the Spartans might persuade
or frighten him into carrying out his promises
to them. The whole Athenian fleet at the new
Athens, as Samos was called, escorted him some
way upon his journey, making no secret of the
mission upon which the general was going to
Tissaphernes. The <i>Eros</i> was refitted, and if not
quite so gay as it had been before time, and if
hard work had made both the ship and its
commander look less glorious than they had
once appeared, yet, as he stood once more on
the well-known deck, he could almost fancy that
all was as it had been four years ago.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>There was no attempt to avoid the Lakedaimonian
navy as he went: he rather courted their
attention. One of his purposes in going was to
show the Spartans the power that he still had with
Tissaphernes, although they, in his absence, had
been endeavouring to undermine it. He landed
with his retinue at Paniônion, and his armed cavalcade
made an imposing show as it wound through
the lovely grove where the Ionian cities met in
solemn conclave to discuss the policy of all the
several colonies, and where the Paniônian games
were held, and thence along the delightful valley
which lies between Mount Thorax and the Maiandros,
and so through vales and hills, till it reached
the residence of the Persian satrap.</p>

<p class='c010'>How different was his entry into Magnesia now
from what it had been when, a fugitive from
treacherous Spartans, he came to ask for shelter
and asylum! The state with which he travelled
was not without its special reasons. If he wished
to impress the Spartans and his fellow-countrymen
with his power over the Viceroy, he also wished
to show the Viceroy his power over his fellow-countrymen.
The meeting between them was as
cordial as ever. Poor Tissaphernes shed tears on
seeing his friend, thinking how soon they would
have to part again. The want of his Athenian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>counsellor when he was gone was as the losing
of a prop, a strong support to lean upon. He
thought, too, of the happy days when his friend
had come as a suppliant asking his protection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades got all that he demanded, and more
than he expected, from the Viceroy. Though he
knew that, when he was gone, the Persian would
be prevailed upon, and perhaps would be obliged,
to break his promises, yet promises were made,
and they would last some little time. And so it
was that the Persian fleet remained for the present
at Aspendos, nor came to help the foes of Athens,
and the poor satrap got worse into disgrace with
his allies, and was openly accused by them of
treason. The Spartan admiral, Astyochos, who
all along had been faithful to his friend, got
into trouble, too, with the commissioners for his
remissness in executing the barbarous order of
the king and ephors, and was recalled, while
Mindaros, a rising sailor, was put into his place.
These were some of the results of the stately
visit of Alkibiades to the viceregal court of
Tissaphernes.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his way back a terrible temptation came
over him, such as has seldom fallen upon any
man. We have seen how, when Chaireas brought
tidings of the doings of the four hundred oligarchs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>to Samos, the Athenian warriors were roused to
such a pitch of fury that they were almost beside
themselves with rage. The first act they called
on Alkibiades to do for them, when they chose
him general, was to take them straightway to
Athens, to avenge the wrong that had been done
to their country and restore her liberties. It was
only his influence, backed by the loud voice of
Thrasyboulos, that had restrained the soldiers
and kept them for the defence of Samos. He
was stronger now. He had good reason to
believe, if he appeared with that large fleet and
all his soldiers at the port of Athens, nothing
could resist him. Why, then, not take them there
on his return to Samos? His power at Samos
was secure, his popularity unbounded; his
influence with Tissaphernes greater, at any rate,
than that of any other. The condition of Athens
was most critical. A strong man, backed as he
would be, would soon restore her native energy
and scare away the swarm of bats whose unclean
wings now flapped about the sacred city. Was
not this the very moment to make the stroke
he had been so long meditating, and give the
<i>coup de grace</i> to the cowardly, the treacherous
four hundred?</p>

<p class='c010'>Once there, his course was clear. Leader of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the people, as Perikles had been—greater indeed
than Perikles, for he would come not as a leader
only, but as a saviour—might he not expect to
rise to greater fame and more enduring honour
than even Perikles had gained?</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the temptation, and it came upon him
like the nightmare which had weighed him down
during the ride he had by night in this same
country more than a year before. As he shook
it off and resisted it with effort, it came again,
and yet again. It was, in truth, a specious and
splendid-looking prospect that was now displayed
before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side was duty—his devotion to his
country, and his willingness to renounce for her his
own particular plans of personal advantage. Was
this the time to stir up civil war, to leave Samos
and the other islands to the mercy of the enemy?
Athens had but one army left, and one navy;
both were under his command at Samos, guarding
the remnant of her Ionian possessions. To take
that force to Athens would be to leave all outside
Attica without any defence to her enemies.
Could he be right in doing that, even for the
holy purpose of restoring liberty and vitality to
Athens? Was this a time to gratify ambition
and aggrandize himself, and wreak his vengeance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>on his enemies, when Byzantion, Abydos, Lampsakos,
were falling off?</p>

<p class='c010'>He thrust the temptation from him. He
refused to purchase his return to Athens at such
a price; he determined he would never set his
foot upon his country’s soil until he came with
hands full of blessings to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he returned to Samos he found his forces
had been gaining strength. Some had come who
had escaped from the tyranny at home, others
from the islands. Among these arrivals was an
embassy from the four hundred formally announcing
the change in the government, and seeking to
gain the army at Samos to its side. These deputies
were received in open assembly, but the Athenian
soldiers were so much enraged they could hardly
be persuaded to listen to them. When they
heard their excuses for the wrongs that had been
inflicted on the people at home their anger became
fiercer; it required all the power of Alkibiades
to save the deputation from his soldiers’ violence.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as they were gone, the whole army
once more entreated him to take them forthwith
to Athens. They declared that the four hundred
could not prevent their landing or their march
from the Peiræus; that the people would hail
them as deliverers, and that the hoplites serving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>under the usurpers would immediately desert
their detested paymasters.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a moment he paused. The anger of the
troops was overwhelming and dangerous. Had
he power to restrain them any longer? If he
refused to lead them, might they not depose him
and choose a more pliant leader? So near the
completion of his work, was he to see it all
destroyed? His hopes so nearly realized—were
they all to be abandoned? And for what? For
a too sensitive regard for a place and people which
had thrust him from them as an evildoer. Must
he stay there always to protect her outposts when,
by a word, he might be ruling in her midst?
How long was he to watch over her here at Samos,
while miscreants ate her life out of her at home,
and were even now negotiating with her enemies
to come and enslave her—enslave his Athens—if
only for a little while they might so prop up
their falling tyranny? Was it not his duty to
put a stop to that? The temptation was getting
too strong for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stand firm now, oh man. It may be some
years yet before you see her. Not more than
half your wandering, troubled exile may be over.
And when you do return to her, your sad fate
may send you quickly off to fight for her again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and you may again be sacrificed by her. And
then through all the ages that shall come, when
historians record your exploits, your victories,
your wrongs, your triumphs; when new peoples
shall have risen on the earth who can afford to
smile at all the extraordinary fuss once made
about your four-horse chariot races; when there
shall be no more wars, and no more massacres of
human folk or mangling of poor helpless animals;
when nations shall no longer intrigue or conspire
against each other, this shall be writ and read
concerning you, as your most glorious deed—that
you refused at such a time to go to govern Athens
at the risk of hurting her, or to return at all to
her till you could come unto that lovely mother
with hands and arms full to overflowing with
the blessings you could shower upon her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>He rejected the temptation. With such a
leader, whom even hostile writers hail as the
liberator, the saviour of Athens—with such a one
to lead them, his warrior citizens could also wait.</p>

<p class='c010'>He pointed out to the excited sailors and hoplites
what the result must be of abandoning this last
Athenian outpost. Though they might save
Athens from the usurpers, there would be little
left to her when all her insular dependencies were
gone.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>‘Let the usurping tyrants alone for a while.
Through their own rottenness they will fall to
pieces of themselves. Athens will have greater
cause to thank us if we preserve her distant
territories than if we abandon them, even to
save her.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus he recalled the troops to reason and to
their duty when some of them were in the act
of leaving Samos in their ships.</p>

<p class='c010'>When this ardour was quieted for a time, there
came a welcome embassy from Argos. Those
old friends and allies of his were true to him
still, although he had beaten fifteen hundred of
them at Miletos. They had been disgusted with
the proceedings of the rest of the Athenians, but
now that they heard he was at the head of affairs
at Samos, they sent to offer their assistance in
restoring to Athens her democracy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Things were in such a good way in that island
now that he was able to send Thrasyboulos with
five triremes to blockade Eresos, in the island of
Lesbos, which had revolted, and he was preparing
another squadron to help the other fleet, which
was still blockading Chios, when most exciting
news came, interrupting all his other plans and
preparations.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had kept himself well informed of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>was going on at Magnesia. The immediate future,
perhaps the long-distant future, for both Athens
and Sparta depended at this moment on Tissaphernes.
The two Greek fleets balanced each
other pretty evenly. Any addition to either
would turn the scale. An addition of three
hundred, or even one hundred, big warships to
either side must swamp the other hopelessly.
So now, when on the tenth of August, according
to our style, 411 years before our era, Agrestides
came with secret intelligence that Tissaphernes,
at length seriously frightened by threats of
Spartan commissioners to break off the alliance
and return to Sparta and leave Athens to
recover her old dependencies, had actually set
off himself for Aspendos to fetch the Persian
fleet, and had taken the commissioner Lichas
and the commander Philippos with him, that
they might see for themselves that he really was
this time in earnest, then Alkibiades felt he must
act at once, and with the greatest speed and
energy, if this decisive action was by any means
to be prevented.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Agrestides left the mainland for Samos
with the news, Tissaphernes, in his state long-ship,
followed by the Spartans in two triremes,
had also left Miletos, and was now coasting down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the Asiatic continent, and must, by the time the
message reached Alkibiades, have got some
distance on his way. The general knew Persian
habits, and that Persians were not fond of moving
too rapidly. He knew it took some time to
overcome the <i>vis inertiæ</i> that was in their nature,
and that in the case of Tissaphernes the habitual
deliberation which marked their movements would
not be easily startled into action on a business
which, for more than one reason, he wished
to be indefinitely postponed. Alkibiades knew,
too, that there were no three hundred ships
lying off Aspendos, and that Persian authorities
did not waste their wealth on ships of war, which
might never be wanted after all. He knew how
many and great were the opportunities of spending
their revenues in a way which more nearly
concerned their own enjoyments. So he guessed
that the voyage of Tissaphernes to Aspendos would
not be rapid if he were left to himself. But
there were two energetic Spartans with the satrap,
and these might urge him on. So Agrestides had
hardly finished his disquieting news before orders
had been given to get thirteen of the quickest
triremes in readiness to start in pursuit of the
satrap and the persistent Spartans.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a hot, dreamy day when the <i>Eros</i>, followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>by the twelve swift Athenian ships, stood out of
the harbour of Samos. They gave Miletos a wide
berth. This was not a time for fighting; the
general had other cares just now, and though
his oarsmen pulled their hardest, the pace seemed
all too slow for Alkibiades. His first object was
to get to Kaunos, in Karia, before Tissaphernes left
that port. Tissaphernes, he believed, must stop
at Kaunos for water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great eyes carved on the prow of the good
ship <i>Eros</i> seemed to start with expectation and
impatience as it breasted the smooth sea. By
Kos and Knidos they scudded on. They saw
the Spartan ships that had been left in Rhodes
harbour still lying there, as at last with full
swing they turned up north-easterly to Kaunos
before the sun had set. But for all this haste,
when they reached the port the Persian satrap
and his Spartan monitors had been there and
were gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>They got in water and what provisions were
required, and left again at daybreak, the sea
still smooth as glass. Not a breath of wind
came to fill the sails, and though a hundred
times that day Alkibiades reminded himself that
Tissaphernes and the Spartans were as much
delayed by the incidents of weather as he was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>it was difficult to console himself with that
thought. He wanted to go fast and faster, to
keep pace with his anxious mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Are we gaining on them?’ he said to Antiochos,
his pilot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Antiochos did not know. No one knew.
They only knew that the Persian state ship was
the swiftest one the Viceroy had, and that the
Spartans were not likely to have chosen slow
ones for their present purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Phaselis was the next port Tissaphernes must
make for on his journey to Aspendos.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘When could they reach Phaselis? Can anyone
see Phaselis? Were there three triremes
anywhere ahead?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No; only land on the left-hand side, no
triremes.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He called to the master of the rowers to redouble
the vigour and the quickness of their
strokes. But the poor sweating rowers had all
day been toiling their very hardest at the oars.
No Persian slaves on the state trireme, for all
the whips of all the masters, could ever row like
these men.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘We must be gaining on them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>On and on they went, due east now, right
through the Lykian on to the Pamphylian Sea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>for many slowly-passing hours that seemed interminable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now they turned up northerly, past the point
Hieron, past the small island of Kambrousa.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘How much further to Phaselis now? A
hundred stades?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘More than that.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What is that rock, those two distant rocks?
Are they not rocks jutting out from the sea, with
a thin line on each side of them? If the Spartans
shall have made the weary Tissaphernes leave
Phaselis before we get there, and we are kept
long in watering, they will be at Aspendos before
us after all, and what of the Persian fleet then?
Perhaps we may be yet in time to stop their
leaving.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The two high rocks grew higher out of the water,
more distinct. An old sailor whom the general
called up to his side knew them.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, that is Phaselis.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Can anyone see three triremes there?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No, not yet. There are some specks about.’</p>

<p class='c010'>Antiochos went aloft again.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They look long; they must be ships. They
cannot be common fishing-boats; too big.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Are they triremes?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Perhaps they are.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>The old sailor was standing near the pilot,
shading his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are they triremes?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Yes, they are.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Which way are they looking?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Seaward, I think.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Row on now as you have never rowed before.
Each one of you shall have his name up at the
Agora at Athens—a drachma a day for life.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Are they moving?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No—yes, yes. By Zeus! I see the oars move
now. They are out of port.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ye gods! shall we ever catch them? Turn
your prow straight for them. Never mind Phaselis;
make for the longest ship.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They are well out now, making fast north-north-east,
right for Aspendos. They see us.
The smaller ships are behind. They are gaining
on the long one; she is slacking. Now they are
close to her; now they are nearly alongside of
her.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What are they doing now?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘The long ship has stopped. We shall catch
them yet.’</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact, when Tissaphernes heard it was the
<i>Eros</i>, Alkibiades’ own ship, that was pursuing him,
he ordered his rowers to slacken speed, and, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the high commissioner Lichas and the commander
Philippos came up to him in wonder, he declared
he dared not go on with the Athenian fleet upon
them; at any rate, he must wait to hear what
message these vessels might be bringing.</p>

<p class='c010'>So before nightfall Alkibiades had come aboard
the Persian state long-ship, and Tissaphernes had
embraced his friend once more. Lichas and
Philippos had been allowed to leave under cover
of the darkness, in great disgust at the weakness
of the satrap, and had gone back towards Miletos,
and the Athenians went on, together with the
Persian state ship, to Aspendos.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a gay and happy time for Tissaphernes
as he was rowed slowly in his great ship over the
pleasant water, rid at last of those troublesome
Spartans, who were always in earnest, always
wanting to talk politics. He had his friend with
him to amuse him and join him in his pleasures
as of old.</p>

<p class='c010'>They found the fleet—that terrible great fleet
indeed!—lying off Aspendos. Certainly they were
a goodly array of ships to look at from a distance.
Though not three hundred—there were a hundred
and forty-seven of them there—joined as auxiliaries
with the Spartan force, they would have settled
the question between Athens and Lakedaimon.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>On closer inspection, even Tissaphernes had
to admit they were not perfect. Dirty beyond
description, with oars broken, planks starting and
torn sails, to the Athenian sailors, accustomed to
Greek niceness and perfection, they looked pitiable
and disgusting objects.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tissaphernes ordered them all back to the
Phœnikian coast, and, with the help of his witty
friend, made up and sent to Lichas the following
curious reason for not keeping the promise he had
made to Sparta:</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Whereas by some, at present undiscovered,
accident, my lord the King had not sent more
than one hundred and forty-seven long-ships,
and, as it appears to me, his viceroy, unworthy
of the King of Kings that he should send
to aid so great and powerful a people as the
Lakedaimonians so small a fleet, I, Tissaphernes,
the aforesaid viceroy, have sent them back
again.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This cynical defence, suggested by Alkibiades,
for the breaking of the solemn promises given
at least three times in as many separate treaties,
pleased his Persian friend. It suited the wily
nature of the man; and when the two parted
at Aspendos, as soon as Alkibiades could get
away, their love and friendship seemed stronger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and likely to be more lasting than it had ever
been before. And grave historians ever since
have been puzzling their heads why it was that,
although Tissaphernes allowed the Spartan envoys
to go with him to fetch the fleet, the Spartans
never did get it after all, and why he gave so
curious an excuse for sending it back to the
Phœnikian coast again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Strange</span> events were happening at home while
Alkibiades was successfully chasing the Persian
satrap and his Spartan companions. When the
envoys of the four hundred to Samos returned to
Athens, the account they gave of the force they
found there, its strength and unity, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>complete confidence of all in their commander,
revived the slumbering or drooping energy of
the Athenian people, and roused them to do
something more than sigh for their lost liberties.
It also alarmed the usurpers, and the more
moderate or more timid among them began to
tremble for themselves. Alkibiades, they in their
guilty consciences thought, with his stalwart
hoplites and his gallant sailors, might be on
them any day, and they dreaded what would
come from the pent-up anger of the people when
it was once set free.</p>
<p class='c010'>Theramenes, one of the earliest promoters of
the new order, was the first to desert his colleagues.
He was followed by a large number
of the four hundred. These reformers of the
others proposed a constitution which would allow
all citizens capable of bearing arms to be joined
to the new government. Antiphon, Phrynichos,
and Peisandros opposed this proposition with
all their might. To save themselves from their
impending doom, Antiphon and Phrynichos went
off in haste to Sparta, empowered to offer the
most shameful terms to the old inveterate enemy
of Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is a point of land called Eetiôneia, which,
starting from the spot where the long walls ended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>at the Peiræus, juts out some way into the harbour.
This piece of land the four hundred had been
for some time mysteriously fortifying by erecting
a wall along it on the harbour side, and connecting
it with another wall already existing
on the other side at its extreme point, where they
met and ended in a tower. They also enclosed
the great granary and warehouse at the harbour,
and compelled the corn ships coming from Euboia
to unload there.</p>

<p class='c010'>These fortifications were pushed on apace, but
not without exciting the suspicions of the people.
It was spread about—and Theramenes was at
the bottom of the rumour—that the real design
of this new fort was to give the four hundred, as
they were still called, absolute command of
Athens, and power to admit a Spartan force,
whenever it might come to help them. Theramenes,
more and more breaking away from the
others, as he found the people willing to listen
to him, at length declared, without disguise,
what the object of the new wall at Eetiôneia was.
He told them that Antiphon and Phrynichos
had gone to Sparta to implore the Spartans to
send a fleet to Athens, to make the people the
slaves of the usurpers and their enemy, who had
combined together for their ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>This so enraged the people against Phrynichos
that, soon after his return, he was openly slain
in daylight by a young soldier in the market-place,
and his bones were afterwards cast out of Attika
as being those of a traitor and unworthy of
sepulture within that territory, and the soldier
was rewarded for the deed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hoplites who were engaged upon the building
of the defence-works rose against the government,
and began to demolish the new walls they had
been ordered to construct, and imprisoned one of
the officers set over them. Then news came that
a Spartan fleet was actually approaching, and that
forty-two ships were seen off the coast of Salamis.
The whole city rushed down to the Peiræus to
defend it, got together as many ships as they
could find, and, hastily arming, followed the
enemy’s fleet, which, passing Sunion, put in at
Orôpos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenian armament, with its sailors hurriedly
got together and for the most part inexperienced,
were no match for their opponents. They were
utterly defeated. Twenty-two ships of the small
remnant of Athens’ fleet were lost, and their crews
were either killed or taken prisoners. The Lakedaimonians
got possession of Euboia, the granary
of Athens—a blow almost as fatal as if they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>taken the town itself. No greater consternation
ever seized upon the city. This was worse than
the loss of her fleet and men at Syrakuse.</p>

<p class='c010'>The government was at its wits’ end, and
the members of it were divided amongst themselves.
Their overtures to Sparta being spurned,
they trembled for their lives. The people
met, as though by inspiration, in their old
meeting-place, and, without a sign from their
late tyrants, proceeded to depose them. So
they disappeared after a reign of barely five
miserable months. Many of them went over to
the enemy at Dekeleia, and did what further
injury they could to Athens. Others were
allowed, with ignominy, to return to their former
obscurity. Only Antiphon, perhaps the best
among them, and one other publicly suffered the
death they all deserved. The spot where their
houses once stood was marked by a stone recording
that there had lived a traitor. Athens
again enjoyed the constitution, with the assembly,
the senate and the executive, which had been
given to it by Perikles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Samos was still jubilant at the fall of the four
hundred and the restoration of the democratic
government at home when the <i>Eros</i>, at the head
of the twelve other ships, rowed into the port.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>The good tidings of the exciting and successful
chase had scarce been told before an Athenian
messenger came from the restored senate and
Ekklesia to the commander of the forces at Samos,
confirming him in the high office already conferred
upon him by the Samian garrison. But he found
the main fleet he had left behind with Thrasyllos
gone. In his absence Mindaros, the new Spartan
admiral, had stolen quietly out of Miletos, but
Thrasyllos, having had notice of his going, had
followed in his wake with fifty-five warships, had
picked up Thrasyboulos with his five triremes at
Eresos, and had met Mindaros and had a brush
with him already in the Hellespont.</p>

<p class='c010'>A despatch soon came from Thrasyllos describing
these movements, and imploring the
chief to come without delay and bring them reinforcements,
as a serious conflict was every
day expected. For, when Philippos returned to
Miletos and exposed the way in which the Spartans
had been cheated by the fickle Tissaphernes at
Pharselis, Mindaros, despairing of getting aid
from the Lydian satrap, made overtures to
Pharnabazos, the powerful viceroy of the Propontine
provinces, offering to join him in his
province. Alkibiades knew that the offer would
be accepted, and that Pharnabazos had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>endeavouring for the last four years to make
alliance with the Spartans against Athens. He
had not much doubt that the sudden departure
of the Spartan fleet northward to the Hellespont
was for the purpose of joining Pharnabazos.
The combined forces, unless they were successfully
opposed, would have little difficulty in getting
possession of the Hellespontine towns which were
still faithful to Athens. Abydos and Lampsakos
had already fallen off; a little show of power on
the Spartan side would decide the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a time of great anxiety, and it would be
of the utmost importance if the coalition forming in
the north could be destroyed. He had confidence
in Thrasyllos, but one false step, one check, at
this moment would be well-nigh fatal. He was
working night and day getting supplies together.
There were only fifteen ships in all now left at
Samos. It was of no use to attempt to go to reinforce
Thrasyllos with so small a squadron. He
managed to get seven more together from Kos, and
to obtain a large sum of money from Halikarnassos,
when a fresh despatch came from Thrasyllos, who
had come up with Mindaros between Troas and the
Thrakian Chersonese. There a stubborn action
had been fought, the Athenian line stretching
from Sestos round the promontory of Kynossema.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>At first the Spartans and Syrakusans had
the best of it, but in the end the Athenians destroyed
thirty ships of the hostile fleet, took eight
others, and forced the rest to retreat into the
harbour of Abydos.</p>

<p class='c010'>News of this victory came to Alkibiades at the
very moment when an embassy arrived from
Athens, formally announcing to him that, on the
motion of Kritias and Theramenes, the people
had decreed his recall to Athens, and praying
him to return at once to save her. Had this
announcement come at any other time, it would
have been difficult to describe the joy with which
it was received. Was it not this he had been
living for every day since that withering sentence
had been passed upon him? Now his desire was
accomplished. He was not ungrateful. Great
as was his power of resentment, his generosity
was greater. He could forgive as greatly as he
could punish.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the message came to him when he was resisting
the final blow aimed at the heart of Athens.
He showed his gratitude to her by his noble refusal
of her invitation. The time had not yet come.
With Mindaros and Pharnabazos combined, the
victory of his lieutenants could only postpone a
more serious attack, and they were not strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>enough to meet it. So he must stay at his post
in this supreme hour of danger, and, if necessary,
die in defence of Athens, and could not obey her
voice calling on him to return.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was, indeed, a time for straining every nerve.
He saw in his mind’s eye his triremes in the
Hellespont ranged against a united force of nearly
twice their number, perhaps even now engaging,
perhaps smashed and destroyed, before he could
get to their assistance. Doing all he could, by
the middle of October he had collected only two
and twenty ships altogether, and, despairing of
being able to get more, he set their prows northward.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two Athenian commanders, since their
victory at Kynossema, had stood watching their
opponents, while gathering what supplies they
could find with which they might support their
crews. Their opponents were repairing their
damaged ships and collecting others from friendly
ports. While both sides were thus engaged,
one morning at daybreak a squadron of fourteen
Syrakusan vessels, on their way to reinforce the
enemies of Athens, entered the Hellespont. The
Athenian fleet weighed anchor, and bore down
upon them before they could join the Spartan
fleet lying off Abydos. The Syrakusan admiral,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>finding he could not avoid the Athenians, ran his
ships ashore, disembarked, and posted a number
of his men in a good position on the Trojan coast,
in order to protect the ships. The Athenians
attacking were kept off by the hoplites on the
ships, and assailed by darts and arrows from
the men posted on the high, rocky shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, it so happened that Mindaros had gone
that morning to Ilion to offer sacrifices to Athene.
Thence he saw the Syrakusan vessels entering
the Hellespont and the Athenians coming down
upon them. He sent off at once to Pharnabazos,
and, getting his own ships together, eighty-four
in all, hastened to relieve the Syrakusans. Thrasyllos
saw this great fleet coming, and, drawing
his own ships off into the open, ranged them in
line of battle. He held the left wing, Thrasyboulos
the right.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mindaros came up with his fleet, more than
covering the whole length of the Athenian line;
the Athenians were on the west, or Thrakian, side;
the Spartans, and the Syrakusans, who by this time
had got their ships afloat again and joined their
allies, on the east, near the Dardanian shore.
Shouts and paeans arose on either side as the oars
lashed the water into foam; trumpets sounded
as the great ships dashed at one another. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>courage and determination the combatants were
equal, but the Athenians were fighting for existence,
the Lakedaimonians for victory, the Syrakusans
only for revenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lakedaimonians had a far larger number
of ships, but the Athenians were superior in the
management of theirs. At that time much depended
on the management of vessels. It was
a warfare of ramming and avoiding, but it
was a splendid warfare. When ship grappled
ship, the very attitude in hurling the javelin
was graceful and healthy. With open chest,
and every muscle starting, with the body set well
back upon the legs, the air of heaven was breathed
more fully than nowadays as we fight. Then
was the noble tug and tussle, where man clasped
man, and where individual strength exhibited
called forth the admiration of opponents.</p>

<p class='c010'>All that day the battle raged with varying
success. The Spartans lost more than the
Athenians; they could afford to lose more. As
the October day was drawing in, and the Athenians
showed signs of wavering, and their commanders
began to fear the enemy would prevent
them from carrying off the remnant of their
disabled triremes—just in their final struggle,
the full sails of a fresh squadron were seen coming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>with a fair wind, round the Sigeion Cape. Mindaros
thought it must be the reinforcement he
was expecting from Miletos, but as it came on
before the wind, with all sails set, a purple ensign
was run up—the well-known purple ensign—and
the <i>Eros</i> came bursting through the waves, and
on its prow, in shining panoply, thirsting for the
fight, stood Alkibiades, his armour flashing in
the red rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>Onward they came, and when the Athenians
recognised their general, they plucked up heart
and redoubled all their efforts, and sent up such a
cry of joy and thanks, that the Spartans and Syrakusans,
when they heard it and saw who it was
that came speeding through the sea against them,
lost their courage, and before Mindaros could rally
his astonished crews the Athenian leader was upon
them, breaking through their line and scattering
their ships on all sides in disorder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mindaros sounded a retreat, and his fleet made
for Abydos. Most of the triremes ran ashore; the
crews and soldiers leapt out, and ranged themselves
upon the bank. The Athenians followed, and,
notwithstanding the darts and arrows from the
shore, they were in the act of grappling the deserted
triremes, when Pharnabazos rode up with all his
cavalry and charged the Athenians, the satrap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>himself leading his men and fighting in the sea,
with the water up to his horse’s girths. But for
this barbaric aid the whole of the Spartan fleet
would have been lost. As it was, the Athenians
took more than thirty of their big ships and
carried them off in triumph.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great was the rejoicing of the victors when
they got back to Sestos, bringing their spoils
with them. Fresh hope and confidence sprang
up amongst them—hope, which had been a stranger
to Athenian arms for many a day, and confidence,
which seemed to have abandoned them. They
had shown themselves worthy sons of Athens,
able to hold their own, and to protect their
liberated mother from the force of Lakedaimôn
and Persian barbarian combined against her.
They raised a trophy on the promontory of
Kynossema by the side of that one which Thrasyboulos
and Thrasyllos had placed there more than
a month before, and then, with games and feasts,
they celebrated the funeral rites of those who had
fallen in the fray.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a time, though, to indulge long in
feasts and triumphing. The enemy was still
strong and not far off, while they were poor,
wanting in almost everything except in courage
and in hope. Next day Thrasyllos went off to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Athens to carry tidings of the fight and victory,
and to get, if possible, some reinforcements.
Thrasyboulos visited the cities on the coast,
collecting tribute and provisions for the fleet,
and going as far south as was consistent with his
duties as its commander. Alkibiades accompanied
him so far, and then went on to Paniônion.
He had heard that Tissaphernes had returned
from his journey to Aspendos, and was at Magnesia
purposing to come north to visit Pharnabazos.
Alkibiades saw that this meeting of the
two satraps must be stopped at any hazard.</p>

<p class='c010'>The <i>Eros</i>, decked out in its best array, with
the ensign of the strategos flying at its masthead,
looked like itself again as it coasted the
Ionian shore and entered the little harbour near
Paniônion. Alkibiades received information that
Tissaphernes was at Magnesia still, but that he
was just on the point of leaving on his progress
to visit Pharnabazos, if he had not already
started. A Persian friend he met at Paniônion
warned him somewhat mysteriously that it would
be wiser not to venture inland, or trust himself at
all just now in Persian territory. But he believed
still in his influence with Tissaphernes, and was
sure that, if he could but see him before he left,
all would be right; and though the significance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the warning he had just received did not escape
him, it made him the more determined to push
on without delay to Magnesia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Taking, therefore, only a lieutenant named
Mantitheos with him, and a couple of sailors to
carry some presents he was bringing for his old
friend, he set off at full speed for the place he
knew so well. He reached in good time the
paradeisos or park of the satrap. Tissaphernes
was not there, but was said to be at the castle
of Magnesia, just about to start. He hurried
on. The castle was surrounded by a force of
Persian cavalry. The whole place was full of
soldiers.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Alkibiades and Mantitheos, followed by
the sailors bearing the presents, came near the
citadel, they saw the guard was in marching
order. There was a busy look on every face, a
feeling of movement and bustle in the air, very
different from the ordinary sleepy quiet of the
town. They made their way through the crowd
of soldiers outside the gate and the mounted
guard within. Alkibiades congratulated himself
that he had come just in time to catch the satrap
before he left, and so perhaps would be able to
stop his going, or, at least, might be able to
ride with him on his journey. Who could tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>what the effect of his persuasion might be now
that he had such an opportunity?</p>

<p class='c010'>They were received by the well-known Nubian
chamberlain with his usual deference. He did
not seem astonished. He must have heard that
they were coming. The sailors remained in the
outer hall; the strategos and his lieutenant were
ushered into the state room of the castle. This
reception was so unusual that Alkibiades began to
wonder what it meant. On former occasions Tissaphernes
had always come out to meet him, and
with emotion and many fond caresses had hung
about his neck in long, if not to the Athenian
very agreeable, embraces. Still they waited, and
no satrap came.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length an official entered, followed by some
young slaves bearing an elegant repast, with
flowers and fruit and the choicest shiraz cooled
in the snow, which was lying thick upon the
mountains, but still no satrap. Alkibiades asked
the official when the viceroy of the King of Kings
would deign to receive his servants. The official
answered him that the viceroy of the King of
Kings was busily engaged just then with orders
from the King of Kings, and could not yet have
the pleasure of visiting his illustrious guests,
and then retired with a lowly reverence.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Just then a loud blast from a broad-mouthed
Persian trumpet sounded, and there was a clatter
of horses’ feet. From the high windows a cavalcade
was seen passing through the courtyard, and
out by the castle gate.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘By the gods!’ cried Alkibiades, ‘there is that
rascally Tissaphernes in the middle of them.
He shall not escape me yet. I will be after him
and astonish the Spartans, who think they have
got him from me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>He clapped his hands, but no one came.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sent Mantitheos to call the slaves. The
door was fastened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Great drops stood on the pale face of Mantitheos.
He was for rushing to the windows and
escaping by them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades laughed savagely.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘With a troop of Persians to cut you to pieces
when you fall down, with broken bones, among
them. Keep still. This is a conspiracy between
Mindaros and Pharnabazos. They have brought
Tissaphernes round to their side before I could
get hold of him. Poor Tissaphernes! he is more
unhappy at this moment than I am. We can
but die once, though I confess I should have
liked to live a little longer.’</p>

<p class='c010'>They tried the inner rooms. Two were fitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>up with couches, one sumptuously. The hours
went by. It grew dark. The trumpets sounded.
Guard relieved guard. The neighing of horses
was heard. Lights began to twinkle in the town
and camp. Still no one came. All was silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ye gods, we have been caught this time in a
trap!’ So saying, with a short laugh he threw
himself down upon a sumptuous couch and
slept. In the morning he and Mantitheos were
awakened by a polite chamberlain. He was
followed by a guard of finely-dressed and well-armed
cavalry officers. The chamberlain inclined
with deep respect, and made many
apologies if any inconvenience had been suffered
by the distinguished strategos. ‘It grieved
him to the heart to be obliged to inform the
distinguished strategos that his master Tissaphernes
had been obliged to set out only the day
before for his capital of Sardis, there to receive
a special envoy from the King of Kings, and,
as his master had been unable to receive his
noble guest in his castle at Magnesia, he prayed
that he would honour him by a visit at his castle
at Sardis; and, as an escort for the journey, a
guard of horsemen were at his service, and were
now, in fact, awaiting his pleasure in the court
below.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Alkibiades bowed and smiled. Neither was
taken in. The one knew the whole meaning of
the message, and its depth of treachery; the
other was perfectly aware that it was known.
They descended into the courtyard. Alkibiades
was assisted to mount an Arab horse; another
was provided for Mantitheos. On asking for the
sailors who had come with him, he was told they
had returned to Paniônion. The two travellers were
preceded by twenty horsemen armed with spears.
On each side of them rode an officer with drawn
sword; in the rear came twenty other horsemen
with spears. So they started from Magnesia.</p>

<p class='c010'>At mid-day they halted. An ample meal was
served. They pursued their way, along the
banks of the Hermos, to the fertile plains where
the old town of Sardis stood beneath its lofty
citadel. They passed the new paradeisos that
Tissaphernes had lately finished. Through its
wooden palings they could see its various wonders,
its splendid trees, and its pavilions, and the fountains
and curious waterworks and lakes which the
satrap had formed from the gold-bearing Paktôlos,
which ran through it. On account of its grace
and beauty, as well as with a view to the pleasant
hours he had hoped to spend there with his friend,
Tissaphernes had named this paradise ‘Alkibiades.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The prisoners were received with every mark
of courtesy and with real kindness by the governor
of the citadel. Alkibiades was cheerful. There
was still some chance of hearing news of Tissaphernes.
After a week of close confinement
they were allowed to take as much exercise as
they liked in the governor’s garden, shut in only
by the high outer wall, and closed by the great
gate near which the governor lodged. Alkibiades
soon won the affections of his keeper. He had
noticed from the first the kindness with which he
treated him. As the time hung heavily upon him,
he was glad to talk to the old officer, who at last
confided to him the cause of his imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Orders had come some time ago from the Great
King to take Alkibiades, alive or dead. The affair
of the fleet had got Tissaphernes into terrible
trouble with the Spartans. By taking their fleet
away from the Ionian coast to the Hellespont
they enabled Pharnabazos to collect the tribute
for the Persian king from the Greek cities in that
part. Tissaphernes knew that if Pharnabazos
sent his tribute to Suza, the king would hear no
excuse why the rest of the Ionian tribute should
not be paid. If one satrap could collect and pay
it, then the other must do so, or make it up out
of his own property. This question of the tribute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>had been a long-standing trouble. While Athens
was mistress of the sea there was a good reason
why the Lydian satrap could not enforce it;
but when Athens was weakened, and could no
longer hold her own or protect her colonies, this
excuse must cease.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenian victory at Abydos frightened
Tissaphernes still more. It now seemed that the
balance of power between the two chief Greek
states would not be maintained. The Athenians
would preponderate if many more victories such
as that were gained.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the Persian policy to keep them at war,
weakening one another, until they were reduced to
such weakness that they might both be driven from
the sea. To take Alkibiades away, to keep him
in confinement at this time, would stop any more
Athenian victories for the present. At any rate, it
would show to the Spartans, Tissaphernes thought,
how sincerely he was on their side, and to the
king, his master, that he was ready to sacrifice
his personal affection for his friend to that master’s
service.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was time to do something to pacify both.
The Lakedaimonians were threatening to end the
war, and retire with the remnant of their force to
Sparta, while the king was growing something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>more than suspicious of his satrap’s fidelity.
These, then, were the reasons why he had ordered
the arrest of his dearest friend. And when the
friend had so unexpectedly run into the snare,
he had left without seeing him, for fear his resolution
might be shaken, and he tried to soothe
his own regret at having to treat so badly one he
sincerely loved by giving commands that every
attention should be paid the Athenian strategos
while he was in captivity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>It</span> is not pleasant to be shut up in prison for a
fortnight, expecting every day that poison, or a
dagger, will make that one your last. But even
to that the prisoner gets accustomed in time, and
the danger of assassination begins, at last, to lend
some excitement to life, spent in the horrible
monotony of such a situation. Alkibiades was
not afraid of death. His determined resistance to
it when it had been openly decreed against him
by the Athenians, and secretly by king Agis and
the Ephors at Sparta, was caused as much by
the sense of the injustice of it as from any fear
of death itself. Now, though he enjoyed his life
as much as any man, he expected death with
calmness, and thought of it each day as just
about to come with perfect equanimity.</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Perhaps it could not have come at a time more
opportune, if come it must. He had just won a
splendid victory for his repentant fellow-countrymen.
He had shown his devotion to them, and
they had called on him to return to them and
forget the past. Their bygone injustice he had
forgiven; and if he died now, the victim of a
conspiracy among their enemies, it would be a
fresh cause for them to honour him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the constant thought that he was shut up
at such a crisis, while the Lakedaimonians and
the Persians were planning fresh attacks and
strengthening their forces, while only inexperienced
lieutenants were left to protect his country,
hung upon him insupportably all day long, and
maddened him through the long dark winter’s
nights, with its constant crushing weight. He
determined to risk everything in his endeavour
to get back to join his comrades.</p>

<p class='c010'>How to escape was now his constant thought.
His prison at first was strictly guarded, and
if he could surmount the physical difficulty of
high walls, there were greater difficulties beyond.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a man is shut up in prison with nothing
but his own thoughts, those thoughts are constantly
turning on some means of escape. If he
is a man of great resources he will generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>manage, in time, to circumvent his keepers, who
only think occasionally, and as a matter of routine,
how they may keep him in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another week passed, in dull monotony. His
gaoler could tell him little of the outside world.
He only heard that Tissaphernes was with Pharnabazos
on the shores of the Hellespont. Then
nearly another week went by in the same dead
silence, broken only by the singing of the guard
and the exchange of passwords as they relieved
each other, while he was consumed with rage,
bursting with impatience to be out and doing.</p>

<p class='c010'>And here, here he was shut up with nothing
to look at but the fine Grecian theatre and racecourse,
lying at the foot of the high rock, or the
constant, endless view from his prison windows of
the peaceful valley of the Hermos, and of the
country beyond, stretching into the dim distance,
a view which may still be seen by the traveller
who ascends to-day the crumbling remains of the
rock on which stood the citadel of Sardis, where
Alkibiades and his companion were imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed to him, however, after a time, that
the guards grew slacker in their watch. Sometimes,
especially in the evening, he noticed that if
a fresh guard did not come at the proper time,
the others, tired of their cold, dreary duty, went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>off before they were relieved. He knew from
old experience how much more the Easterns
leave to chance than the better disciplined Greek
soldiers would dare to do. He could see through
the gateway the tired guard pacing up and down,
and one or two beggars who came for broken
victuals. He sometimes amused himself by
throwing small coins to the half-starved mendicants
to see them scramble for the money.</p>

<p class='c010'>This unwonted good fortune was soon noised
about among the beggars, and brought others,
till, whenever he took his evening exercise, a
number, drawn by news of this largess, clamoured
at the gateway. Even the guards were not above
joining in the scramble sometimes when no one saw
them, and would push the ragged crowd away, to
pick up the scattered coins themselves. Alkibiades
did not discourage this, and the good-natured
warder who was in charge pretended not to see it.
Emboldened by their liberty, some beggars would
even thrust their hands through the bars, piteously
praying for his dole, and still the warder only
laughed if he caught them speaking to his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c010'>So a whole month passed. It was on the last day
of that first month of his incarceration, when the
crowd of beggars was greater, and they were
crying out more loudly than ever as they pushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>their lean, dirty hands through to him, that he
noticed a hand which looked different, stronger
than the others, and which was unopened. Struck
with the strange sight of an unopened hand pushed
through the gates, he gently touched it; it opened
slightly, and he saw a minute scroll rolled up
inside. He took it, unseen by the warder, and
throwing some coins to the poor mendicants,
retired to his room. He opened the scroll. There
was just light enough to read the few words on
the rolled-up papyrus leaf. On it was written
in well-known characters, ‘Hour after sunset
courtyard wall.’</p>

<p class='c010'>In an hour’s time he and Mantitheos were in
the courtyard. It was dark. After waiting a
short time they heard the guard go off singing a
Persian song. All was quiet. Presently a rope
was thrown over the high wall from outside.
Mantitheos fastened the end securely to the
trunk of a tree. To an athlete like Alkibiades,
to haul himself up a wall even of that height was
an easy matter. Mantitheos quickly followed, fear
aiding him in his ascent. First Alkibiades, then
Mantitheos, went down the other side hand over
hand, and arrived at the bottom, with no greater
injury than bleeding hands and legs. They found
a strong, ragged-looking man, in an old Persian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>sailor’s dress, who, throwing the end of the rope
over the wall, walked rapidly in front. The
fugitives followed silently.</p>

<p class='c010'>A light shot for a moment from the warder’s
gate across their path. The voice of the warder
was heard calling after them. No one heeded it.
The light disappeared. The three quickened their
pace. The warder, suddenly roused by the noise,
had cried out on his first impulse, then, realizing
what had happened, held his peace. He had
reason to believe that his lord, having shown his
good faith towards Sparta and the king, would
not be sorry for his prisoner’s escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>In almost less time than it has taken to write
down this speculation on the warder’s thoughts,
the fugitives had made their way down the narrow
track leading from the citadel, had passed by the
side of the ruins of the splendid temple of Kybele,
built by the old Lydian kings, and burnt by the
Ionians before the town was taken by the Persians,
had forded the shallow Paktôlos, and were
soon outside the unwalled town. There, in a
thick wood on the northern ascent of the hill,
they found three small mountain ponies tethered
to a tree. The stranger—who of course was Agrestides—loosed
them, the three mounted, and
away they went!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>By a secluded path with which their guide had
made himself well acquainted, they got into the
wild mountain country of the Tmolian range,
and on they rode through the dark, stormy night.
It was the depth of winter; the rain at first,
and then, as they got higher up, the blinding
snow, blew hard in their faces. Progress was
slow. They dare not keep the level road along
the valley of the Hermos. The only safe path for
them was on the ridge of the chain of mountains
from Mount Tmôlos, over Drakôn, Clympos, and
Mastousia.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ponies, native to the mountains, knew the
path as well in the dark as by day, but their pace
was very slow, and morning was breaking over
Sardis before they had made much way. They
reached at length a ruined temple of Artemis;
there they hid themselves. Mantitheos showed
signs of breaking down; all three were drenched
and tired out.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the day got on it grew finer, and they
determined to venture out again, in hopes of
reaching a small village that Agrestides knew of,
where they might be able to obtain some food.
The snow was thick upon the ground; Mantitheos
was getting weaker. Alkibiades gave him his
cloak, which they had managed to dry at a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>fire which Agrestides had made inside the ruined
temple. Though the snow impeded their progress,
it stopped the dreaded pursuit. They heard
the wolves howling round them, and saw foxes
skulking about, ravenous, like themselves, for
food. There was some difficulty in getting Mantitheos
along. There was no sign of human habitation
till they reached a small, desolate village
at nightfall. Mantitheos was quite worn out.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a poverty-stricken cottage they got shelter
for the night, and some coarse bread and goat’s
flesh, and a little goat’s milk. Mantitheos became
worse. Agrestides would have left him
there. ‘Will you risk your own life for him?’
he said; but Alkibiades refused to go without him,
and amused them by tales of his adventures and
stories about Sokrates—how the philosopher
kept his guard all night at Potidaia in the snow
without any other raiment on him but his summer
dress, and how he would stand sometimes, all
day and night, in silent contemplation, thus
exemplifying his theory, external circumstances
ought never to affect the true philosopher.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was much he wanted to know about:
what had taken place since he left the Hellespont
with Thrasyboulos, after the battle of
Abydos; what the Spartans and Pharnabazos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>were doing; whether the Athenians were making
preparations to drive the Spartans from the
Hellespont and Bosporos. Agrestides could give
him little reliable information about these things,
but he entertained them with an account of how
he had found them, and had managed to help
them to escape. He told his story in a few words,
in his blunt way, taking little credit to himself.
He could not imagine how anyone would have
done less for such a master.</p>

<p class='c010'>For two days after the sailors had returned to
the ship from Magnesia without the strategos
the <i>Eros</i> waited, expecting his return. Then some
officers had gone to the castle at Magnesia for
further orders, and were told that Alkibiades
had set out to visit Tissaphernes, and they learnt
that Tissaphernes had gone north to meet Pharnabazos.
Only by degrees it came out that Alkibiades
was a prisoner, and had been sent, under
a strong escort, no one knew whither. The
sailors were for marching upon Magnesia straight
off, though it was occupied by some hundreds of
Persian soldiers. It was difficult to make them
understand the madness of the attempt. At
last Agrestides was allowed to go in search, with
orders to return if he found any clue to the prison
of the captive strategos.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>He knew the country and the language of the
barbarians, and, disguised as a Persian sailor, it
did not take him long to discover where his master
was confined. He bought the three mountain
ponies on the way, and brought them to Sardis,
pretending he meant to sell them there. When
he reached the satrap’s capital, he made friends
with the sailors who formed the guard of the
citadel, regaling them at the wine-shops on the
supposed proceeds of a prosperous voyage, and
after waiting many days, he at last found means
of getting his message into his master’s hands.
Then he gave the guard, who ought to have gone
on duty an hour after sunset, so much of the
strong wine that grows on the sides of Tmôlos,
that he felt sure they would not trouble themselves
to be too early at their post, and as soon
as the tired guard went off, without waiting for
their relief, the sailor’s rope had done the rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>So two days and nights passed in the rough
cottage, till the rest and warmth, and such food
as they could get, restored the unfortunate
lieutenant sufficiently to let them journey on.
In two days more they reached a small fishing-village
to the eastward of Klazomenai. At dark
they put off in a fishing-boat, and after cruising
about all night, at daybreak they sighted the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span><i>Eros</i> standing off the coast, about a mile north
of Klazomenai. The sailors raised such loud
cries of joy, when their strategos came on board,
that their shouts were heard in the port, as with a
head wind the <i>Eros</i> made for the isle of Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men of Samos were vainly vowing vengeance
on the Persians if their chief was murdered.
Just as the <i>Eros</i> was seen sailing towards
the port, the women were thronging the temple
of Heré, where the great bronze statue of
Alkibiades, the liberator of Ionia, was to be
erected next year, and were sending up prayers
for his safety to the all-powerful Queen of
Olympos, who was born, they said, at Samos.
When they heard that the <i>Eros</i> was arrived, they
left the altar of the goddess, in anxious hope that
she had heard their prayers. There was the
<i>Eros</i> coming onward, with the north-west wind,
in festive trim, and lo! standing on the deck,
appeared the hero for whom such earnest, tearful
prayers had for so many days been offered up.
He was soon in their midst, as fair, as fresh, as
beautiful, as though no trouble or danger had
ever come upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could not stay long at Samos. The tiresome
necessities of glorious war called him away upon
its ordinary business. He had to visit those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the islands which had not been true to Athens
and which had now been abandoned by Sparta,
enforcing contributions for the fleet which, he
determined, should preserve them from both the
Spartan and the Persian. He was at Lesbos
when he received a pressing summons from those
who were left in charge of the fleet in the north
to come at once and take command.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mindaros had collected ships and men from the
islands and from home. He was again at the
head of over sixty triremes, and was backed up
from the shore by the army of Pharnabazos, and
by Pharnabazos himself. As fast as wind and
oars could carry him, Alkibiades made for
Kardia, on the western coast of the Thrakian
Chersonesos. There he collected all the Athenian
strength. Thrasyboulos and Theramenes joined
him. Thrasyllos was still doing his utmost to
collect reinforcements at Athens. When all were
told, the Athenian fleet was but little superior in
numbers to the Spartan, and they had no army
on shore to cover them.</p>

<p class='c010'>In April Mindaros sailed for the island of
Kyzikos, on the Propontis. Pharnabazos marched
his troops along the coast of Mysia to the same
point. The joint force took Kyzikos, the chief
town of the island, at its southern extremity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>where it was joined to the mainland by a bridge.
On hearing of this attack, Alkibiades set sail
from Kardia, doubled the Chersonesos, passed
up the Hellespont, cleverly eluding the Spartan
look-out at Abydos, and, on a dark, rainy night
anchored off the island of Prokonnesos. Next
day he assembled his men on shore, taking care
that the enemy should have no intelligence of
his arrival, and animated them by a stirring
harangue.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though inferior in strength, they must, he said,
fight at once. Delay would be ruin to them, as
they could expect no more help from Athens, while
the Lakedaimonians were fed and paid by their
rich allies. They must fight, then, as they never
fought before, against ships, against men, against
stone walls, and conquer this unholy alliance of
Greek and barbarian, or die like heroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was not afraid to engage the whole Spartan
force at sea. But his difficulty was to get them out
into the open, away from their Persian protection
ashore. With this view he concealed the strength
of his fleet. The night was dark; under cover of
the darkness he sailed in three separate divisions
from Prokonnesos. Theramenes he stationed with
one division to the west, behind the small island
of Alone; Thrasyboulos he sent with another to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the east, round the north point of the island
of Kyzikos; while he himself, with a picked
squadron of twenty triremes, took the centre
or front line, and made straight for the fleet
of Mindaros at the capital of the island.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mindaros, seeing the centre division only coming
against him in the early morning, advanced in
line to meet it with his whole fleet of sixty triremes.
Alkibiades retreated, the Spartan admiral,
with all his force, following him into the straits
between Kyzikos and Alone. Then Alkibiades
wheeled round upon them, the Athenian sailors
managing their long ships splendidly, and at that
moment, on a given signal, Thrasyboulos, with
his division, came round the north point of
Kyzikos, and Theramenes from behind Alone,
taking the Spartan fleet on either flank.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Spartans, attacked thus unexpectedly on
each side, as well as on their main line in front,
were seized with panic. They turned and fled,
followed by the Athenians, who in their pursuit
took or destroyed many of the retreating ships.
The rest made for the mainland, about a mile
from where Pharnabazos was stationed with his
Persian troops. Those on board, running their
ships aground, clambered on to the shore, followed
by the centre line of the Athenian ships, led by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Alkibiades. Thrasyboulos landed his hoplites on
the right of the Persians, and Theramenes, turning
his ships behind the main line, landed his
men near the Persian left flank. The Persians
charged Thrasyboulos, and were overwhelming
him by their superior numbers, when Theramenes
came, unperceived by them, upon their rear.
Taken thus in the rear while they were resolutely
opposed in front, they were thrown into disorder,
and fled with enormous loss. Thrasyboulos and
his force were saved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile Alkibiades had landed with a small
picked body in order, if possible, to prevent the
Spartans from protecting their stranded vessels,
while the rest of his men were seizing those they
could get at. Thus he found himself opposed to
the whole Spartan force. For a long time he held
his own, fighting himself in the front of his men.
This small band of warriors was gradually falling
by his side. He was hard pressed, and that fight
was near proving his last. He was surrounded
by the enemy, who cut off his retreat. There
could have been no possible escape had not his
two colleagues, fresh from their triumph over
the Persians, come up just in time to save him.
Victory was thus snatched from Mindaros and
the Lakedaimonians. The valiant Spartan admiral,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>undismayed at this turn of affairs, so sudden
and little expected by him, fought on with his
accustomed bravery till he fell, mortally wounded,
at the head of his followers, encouraging them
to the last by his words and his example. The
Spartans, seeing their leader fall, broke and fled,
pursued by the conquerors, leaving the whole of
their fleet behind, and a multitude of slain and
wounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades was hailed by his army as ‘the
invincible,’ and well they might so call him. He
had rid Ionia, the Hellespont, the Bosporos, of
Spartan interference, and undone the work of
three years’ strenuous labour of the enemy.
Their fleet was destroyed, and their army was
reduced to a miserable number and condition,
broken in spirit, and without a leader. They
knew not what to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>At Sparta the news of the defeat was received
with consternation. In her necessity she thought
at last of peace. Endios, the old friend and
relative of Alkibiades, was sent to sound the
Athenian senate. Alas! the Athenians were too
elated. Unhappily for them, they spurned the
overtures, which, had they been accepted, might
have changed the coming pages of their history
and the future life of Alkibiades. Peace was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>not to be either for them or for him; he had
to abide the course of destiny, and live and die
in constant toil and struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having put in order his fleet, which had been
enormously increased by all the triremes taken
from the enemy, he proceeded to reduce the towns
upon the coast, which still held out against him,
and to receive the submission and tribute of the
others. A whole year was spent in these active
and profitable operations. In June of the next
year, 409, Thrasyllos joined him at Lampsakos
with a new squadron of fifty triremes and a body
of hoplites from Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pharnabazos had during this last year shown
much more spirit than the Lakedaimonian government.
Persian gold was freely spent among the
Spartan soldiers, and a naval arsenal was provided
for them by him at Antandros, near Mount
Ida, where wood for the building of new ships
could be obtained by them in abundance. An
immense body of men were there set to work to
form a fresh navy, to replace the one they had
lost at Kyzikos. But Alkibiades did not leave
him long in peace. He attacked and routed him
at Abydos, taking a prodigious amount of booty,
including the money that was on its way to pay
the Spartan soldiers and sailors at Antandros, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>also making many prisoners. Among the captives
were some Persian priests. These he treated with
respect and courtesy, and sent them back to
Pharnabazos unransomed and with presents.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a strong feeling of respect growing
up mutually between these two leaders. If
Pharnabazos was invariably defeated by Alkibiades,
he could not but feel admiration for the
bravery and skill with which his opponent fought.
Pharnabazos from this time began to grow colder
in his support of Sparta, or, at any rate, he began
to feel the hopelessness of continuing the struggle
with one who seemed endowed with more than
ordinary force and genius.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the winter passed. In the spring Alkibiades
continued his victorious career. The history
of this year is a catalogue of the coast towns and
islands which he took from the control of Sparta,
and brought back to their old tributary dependence
upon Athens. Then he made an expedition into
Thrace. Here the cultured Athenian, who had
astonished the frugal Lakedaimonians by the
stern rigour of his life at Sparta, and the soft
Persians by his sumptuous magnificence at the
court of the gentle Lydian satrap, now caused
no less astonishment to the strong and hardy
Thrakians. Bred from their infancy to tame and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>ride their famous wild white horses, they looked
with admiration on his splendid horsemanship.
From very love of him a large body followed
him as volunteers when he returned to carry on
the war against his twofold enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that time the siege of Chalkedôn was being
carried on by Thrasyllos, who had nearly succeeded
in carrying a palisade round the city on
its land side. This wall was now nearly completed.
Placed almost immediately opposite
Byzantion and thus forming a firm base of
operations whenever he should attack that most
important city, Chalkedôn, which had lately
thrown off its dependency on Athens, was strenuously
defended by the Spartans. While Thrasyllos
was pushing on his works the Spartan
garrison made a sortie from the town, and Pharnabazos,
co-operating with them, made a simultaneous
dash upon the besieging force with all
his army. At that critical moment Alkibiades
arrived in time to prevent the destruction of the
Athenians thus caught between the Spartans in
front of them and the Persians at their back.
With his new Thrakian cavalry he charged Pharnabazos
with such effect that the gallant Persian
fled discomforted. He then led his troop round
against the Spartans, who retired behind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>walls of Chalkedôn, leaving a large part of their
numbers behind them dead upon the field, including
their commander, Hippokrates.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having finished the wall of palisades by which
the town was completely cut off from the land,
he recrossed the Bosporos, with such troops as
could be spared from the siege of Chalkedôn, to
raise contributions for the war. At Selymbria, a
Greek town on the Thrakian coast of the Propontis,
he was called upon once more to prove
his fearless intrepidity, his calmness and resource
in the midst of danger, and his gentleness in the
hour of victory. He arrived before the town
with a body of his own hoplites and his Thrakian
horsemen. Some of the citizens were willing to
ally themselves with Athens, or rather, perhaps,
were unwilling to struggle against one who seemed
to be invincible. They agreed to open the gates
to him at midnight, and promised to display a
lighted torch upon the walls as a signal that they
were ready to receive him. One of them betrayed
the design to the authorities of Selymbria.
The others, fearing the vengeance of the citizens,
showed the signal from the walls an hour before
the appointed time, and opened the city gates.
Alkibiades, who had given orders for the main
body of his men to be ready to enter the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>with him at midnight, on seeing the signal, though
his men were not yet ready, rushed to the open
gate, followed by only thirty of his guard. He
was joined by twenty of those who were friendly
to him within the town. With this handful of
followers he found himself in the narrow streets
and in the midst of an angry multitude. Here
again he was in imminent peril of his life. He
refused to retreat, although he could not hope
that thirty men, however brave, assisted by only
twenty citizens, could hold their ground until
his hoplites and his Thrakians should come to
his aid. He ordered a trumpet to be sounded,
and as calmly as if he was at the head of a victorious
army, he made a proclamation ‘that
the Selymbrians would incur the anger of the
state of Athens if they dared to take up arms
against the Athenians.’ His extraordinary coolness
so frightened the people, who supposed
a proclamation such as this would never have
been made unless the whole army was behind
him and entering the city, that they asked for
conditions. While these were being arranged
the rest of his army entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Selymbria was now at his mercy. According
to the rights or wrongs of war, he might have
robbed it of its riches and allowed the outrage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of its citizens. He forbade both, and risked
the anger of his half-tamed Thrakians, who could
not understand how a hostile city could be taken
without the necessary consequence of rapine,
by sending them out of Selymbria baulked of
their prey. Taking only a reasonable sum of
money by way of tribute, he left a garrison behind
to protect Selymbria from the Spartans.</p>

<p class='c010'>The feeling of discontent with the policy
of supporting Sparta against such an opponent
now reached its height in the mind of
Pharnabazos. He opened communications with
Thrasyllos, who had been left to carry on the
siege of Chalkedôn while Alkibiades was away
strengthening the power of Athens on the Propontis,
and collecting tribute for the support of
her defenders. He promised an immediate payment
of twenty talents, proposed a treaty of
peace, and offered an escort and safe-conduct
to an Athenian embassy, which he suggested
should be sent to the Great King to settle the
terms upon which a final peace might be made
between Persia and Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the meantime a truce was to be made between
the satrap and Alkibiades. The satrap’s
terms were accepted and the embassy was sent.
It included one whose travels and troubles we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>have already spoken about—the unfortunate
Mantitheos, whose sufferings were now to be
continued for three years to come. But
Pharnabazos was not content with the word or
oath of a subordinate before he withdrew his
troops finally from the support of the Spartans.
He insisted that the general-in-chief must himself
attest his consent to all the terms of the treaty.
Alkibiades confirming them by his own solemn
oath, the satrap made mutual covenants of friendship,
alliance, and hospitality with him, treating
him throughout more as an autocratic sovereign
than as a general-in-chief of a republic.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having fortified Chrysopolis, the port of Chalkedôn,
by building a strong tower which looked
across the narrow strait to Byzantion, Alkibiades
now set about his long-meditated siege of that
important place which was the bulwark of the
Bosporus and the key to the Euxine trade. But
Byzantion was strongly guarded by stone walls
without and by an unrelenting warrior within,
the iron-willed and iron-hearted Klearchos, whom
Sparta had sent as her best commander to hold
a place of such inestimable value. He was
supported by a strong body of his trained citizens
and sturdy Boiotians. The Athenian fleet
blockaded the port and every entrance by sea;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>the Athenian army gradually drew round it on
the land side, and stopped all help from coming
to the famine-stricken people of that great city.
Klearchos closely hoarded the food he had stored
up within. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is wanted by those
who can bear arms and fight; the rest, if needs
be, can starve.’</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no sign of surrender, and the summer
passed away. Overtures were at length made
to the Athenian general by some of the principal
inhabitants. They told him they had no love
for their defenders, that they detested the Spartan
general, who had left them in their dire want to
go to seek aid from Pharnabazos. They agreed
to open the Thrakian gate to the besiegers. Alkibiades
knew how much blood must be wasted
on the assault of such a place. No commander
was ever more careful of the lives of men committed
to his trust than he. In the whole of his
career there is no instance of any reckless sacrifice
of life in order to gain even the most important
conquest, nor of any cruelty done, or permitted
to be done, on those whom the fortune of war
delivered over to his power.</p>

<p class='c010'>If it was possible to get possession of the coveted
city in any other way, he determined to avoid the
carnage on both sides, which must inevitably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>happen if a place so strongly fortified was stormed.
As clever in stratagem as he was fearless in fight,
he made a pretence of retiring from the siege and
carrying his troops away. He ordered the triremes
to row off into the Bosporos, as though
he was abandoning a hopeless task. Then, at
midnight, some of the ships returned, and the
sailors, landing with great clamour, attacked the
eastern gate. The Spartan troops rushed to
that spot and forced the few Athenian sailors
who had landed to retreat to their ships. At
that moment the Thrakian gate was opened by
friends within, and Alkibiades, at the head of
his hoplites, who had silently returned in the
darkness of the night, entered Byzantion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Spartans and their allies discovered the
trick that had been played upon them, and
hastily came back to meet the enemy, who were
now in the centre of the city. But, posted in
strong positions in the main streets and squares,
the Athenians made havoc of both Boiotians and
Spartans, and the Byzantine soldiers turned
upon those whom the people had good reason to
look upon rather as oppressors than protectors.
The Spartans fought with the courage of despair,
but they were all slain at length, except some
five hundred, who surrendered. The inhabitants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>were well treated, although they had revolted
from Athens when she was in her greatest need.
They again accepted her mild sovereignty, and
agreed to pay the usual tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, with Chalkedôn in his power, Chrysopolis
in his hands, and Byzantion garrisoned by Athens,
Alkibiades placed the Euxine Sea in her control
once more. What that meant at such a time can
only be understood when one recollects the extensive
trade of the great inland sea and the low state
to which Athens of late had been reduced. It
drove her enemies out of these waters, and it
gave her whatever dues she chose to impose on
all the rich merchant ships passing to and fro with
their cargoes of slaves, of skins, of fish, and,
what to Athens was more than all, their loads of
corn from the Euxine shores. For she had
been deprived of the produce of her own lands
ever since King Agis and the Spartans had
Dekeleia in their possession, and since the defection
of Euboia, her other granary, she had to
look to the Euxine to supply her with the bare
necessities of life. This was now thrown open
to her.</p>

</div>
<div class='lh'>

<p class='c027'>‘Come, have a care for thine honour, since now this land
calls thee saviour for thy former zeal; and never let it be the
memory of thy government that we were set upon our feet
and afterwards cast down, but lift up this city so that it stand
fast for ever.’—<span class='sc'>Sophocles</span>: <i>Oid. Tyr.</i></p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Upon</span> the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the
Bosporos, the northern Athenian dependencies
were everywhere reduced to their old tributary
subjection to their ancient suzerain; the Spartans
were driven from the sea, and a truce was made
with Pharnabazos, pending negotiations for peace
with the Persian king. In the beginning of the year
407 Alkibiades, leaving Thrasyboulos to complete
the conquest of the Greek cities on the Thrakian
coast, assembled his mighty fleet at Samos.</p>
<p class='c010'>It is unnecessary to describe the advent of the
conqueror once more into that port, where his
faithful friends and supporters had been true to
him when every other Grecian city had turned
against him, and where his statue now stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>gloriously in the temple of the special guardian
of the island, the witness of the people’s gratitude
to the liberator of Ionia.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had still work to do upon the Karian coast,
the last remnant of the late Spartan conquests, and
had more tribute to collect from unfaithful cities for
impoverished Athens. After reducing these places
to subjection and strengthening the forts at Kos,
and with a treasure of one hundred talents which
he had collected, he returned to Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>He now felt that the time was come when he
might at last answer the repeated call of Athens,
and return to his beloved home. He sent Thrasyllos
with the main part of the fleet and a large portion
of the captured ships and other spoils before
him to Peiræus, to prepare the people for his
coming.</p>

<p class='c010'>The impatience with which they awaited him
was indescribable. They were as anxious to
see the man whom they had driven from them,
and who in return, his justice satisfied, had
raised them from despair and misery to their old
supremacy, as he was to come back to them.
This had been the fixed purpose of his life for
eight long years. In spite of the temptation to
return at her earnest cry three years ago, he
had gone on enduring dangers, imprisonment, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>hardships, and adding victory to victory, till he
felt his hands were full enough of blessings.
Now they were so full they scarcely could hold
more, and he returned to her to lay them at her
feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Collecting his great ships from Samos and the
other ports where he had posted them, with all
his prisoners and his prizes, he proudly sailed
towards Attika. No need now to avoid hostile
places; he rather diverged from his straight
course, to show the world who was supreme
mistress of the seas, and on the twenty-fifth of May
he sighted the Peiræus. When the people heard
that he was really coming, the city was deserted.
All the quays and walls were lined with human
beings. The sailors of Peiræus, Mounychia, and
Phaleron, all who had ships or boats of any sort,
crowded out upon the sea to welcome him. The
sea was black with boats. Every mast swarmed
with men and boys, and lucky was he thought
who should first get sight of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>While the people waited on the shore in wildest
expectation, there was but one thought in all
their minds, one and the same subject furnished
the topic of their talk with one another. Some
old men were heard conversing.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ah! you remember the day he set out for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Sicily—just such another day as this. Would
to the gods we had never let him go on that God-cursed
expedition!’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Rather, would to the gods we had let him stay
and fight for us in Sicily! He was just beginning
the great siege when we recalled him. He must
surely have been victorious.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why, then, were we not more wise? Surely
some blindness must have fallen on us from the
gods.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘How many of our sons who perished there
would have been here to-day? Or perhaps we
might have been just about to welcome them,
instead of ever mourning for the deaths of brave
men whose unburied bodies lie underneath the sea.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They would be coming with the conqueror
of Sicily, of Greece, of the barbarian, had we not
been blinded for our sins.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘But, think you, he would have been victorious
at Syrakuse, where two armies of Athenians
fell?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why not? Has he not been victorious everywhere,
wherever he has fought? Are not the
Lakedaimonians better warriors than the men
of Syrakuse? Has he not beaten Spartans and
Persians, too, whenever he has met them?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ay! and they say the fight at Kyzikos was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>greater than any could have been in Sicily, or
any that our men ever fought before.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed, it seems nothing can withstand his
conquering arm.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then to accuse such a one of profanation of
the sacred mysteries! I know not what they
are, but could such a wise man ever think of so
great a wickedness?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘So I said all along, but none would hearken
to me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And the great ones said he wished to make
himself a tyrant in Athens.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘What! he? Why, he could have made himself
a tyrant here any time these last three years.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Or if he had come when the four hundred
were murdering us, and ruining all things in
Athens, the people would have crowned him king.
And, like as not, he will be king, too, before long.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And a good thing, say I for one, for then he
would turn the Spartans out of Dekeleia, and we
should get bread cheap again.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘They say he will not land till they have reversed
the sentence on him. Some say his
enemies will try even now to have it carried out.
But see where the boats make way,—he comes!
he comes!’</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole crowd pressed forward to catch a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>glimpse as ten great Spartan triremes came
slowly forward, their prows and sides covered
with the armour taken at the fight at Kyzikos,
while standing in sullen groups on the decks, were
the Spartan hoplites who had been taken prisoners
there, wearing the red tunics that the Athenians
knew and dreaded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came ten more triremes with Spartan spoils
and prisoners from Abydos; ten others decorated
in like manner from Chalkedôn and Chrysopolis;
then ten more with the five hundred Spartans who
surrendered at Byzantion. Then came ten other
triremes with spoils of Thrakian cities, and with
Thrakian soldiers who had followed the chief out
of admiration for him, clad in skins of beasts,
looking keenly round about them, gesticulating,
and wondering at all they saw. Then came
twenty other triremes, with Persian horsemen
squatting on the decks, dressed in long robes
of every hue, perfectly indifferent to everything.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, gently at first, over the calm, sparkling
sea, came the sound of rhythmic song, growing
gradually louder, and the stately Athenian triremes
came grandly forward, their oars splashing in the
sun, and keeping time to the measured music of
the rowers’ voices as they pulled with one accord
to the beat of the keleustes, who led their singing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Onward they came, majestic,—their sterns,
prows, bulwarks, masts, garlanded with flowers
and boughs of the wild olive-tree. Then, last of
all, amid the shouts and cries of great delight, was
seen the well-remembered <i>Eros</i>, dressed more
plainly than any of the others. And there—yes,
there—apparelled like the sun-god of the
heavens, in his armour of chased gold and ivory,
that glittered in the bright May-day, was Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other triremes ranged themselves on either
side as he came through them. With an unassumed
modesty and a smiling carelessness upon
his face, he could that day with difficulty conceal
the emotion of his soul. Not at Selymbria, when
he found himself with a few followers in the middle
of a hostile town; not at the fight at Kyzikos,
when the engagement was at its hottest, and he
was nearly overcome by Mindaros;—never on any
previous occasion—had the struggle been so hard
as that one now, which called forth all his power
to keep back the flow of tears. The first favoured
ones who welcomed him were his cousin and many
more relations. As soon as he saw them, he came
from off the <i>Eros</i> to the wharf. Cries went up to
Heaven, the crowd closed round him, each one
striving to take his hand, or only touch his garments.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>When a way was made for him it became
a path of flowers. Along this triumphal road,
made by the long walls from Peiræus to the city,
he passed upward to the Peiræian gate, past
the colonnades with their well-remembered paintings,
and the heroes’ statues that he had been
wont to gaze on with wonder when a boy; past
the house of his friend Polytion, where a lying slave
had been tortured to tell the people that he had
profaned the mysteries; and past the many well-known
spots where his boyhood and his early
manhood had been spent—the scenes of his joys,
his pleasures, and his triumphs; and the thoughts
that they brought back swelled up within him,
and made the struggle to restrain his tears grow
ever greater. But when he came to the turning
which led up to the Pnyx, where the people in
their Ekklesia were now assembling to receive
him, there was a pause in the procession, and an
opening in the deep lines of citizens, and out
from amongst them came Deinomache, his mother,
grown almost blind, led by his young son Alkibiades.
As he folded his mother in his arms, the
tears he had so long kept down broke out. It
was the first, the only, time that he was ever
seen to weep. Then he went upward with his
son to the Ekklesia.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>In spite of the enthusiastic welcome with which
the city, and the whole state, received him, he had
not forgotten the dread sentence which had been
passed on him, and which still weighed upon him,
and by the laws of Athens must be carried out,
unless reversed by the same tribunal which had
pronounced it. That was why the meeting of
the great Assembly was held immediately on his
return. That was why he made his way straight
to the Pnyx.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he passed through the assembled people
sitting there in silence, and ascended the stone
tribune, how could he but think of the first time
he had stood there and swayed their wayward mood,
saving them from alliance with that oligarchic
Lakedaimôn which he was afterwards to stir
up against them, and then beat back in its full
career of conquest?</p>

<p class='c010'>He spoke to them simply of what he had suffered
since they had thought fit to cast him out, and
his hearers were moved to tears. Then he spoke
modestly of some of the services he had been
able to render to the state while absent from
them. He deigned not to defend himself against
the charges on which he had been condemned,
for long ago they had been given up as baseless
calumnies. But he did not spare his hearers as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>touched upon the fickleness and injustice often
shown by popular assemblies. Then skilfully
he turned the fault from them, attributing all
the wrongs to his own bad fortune, from which
he had so long suffered, and to the influence
of some evil genius. Then, as though brushing
aside, and forgetting all his own grievances
and troubles, and coming before them only as
strategos, to give an account of his conduct
since they had conferred that post upon him,
with all his peculiar grace and terseness, he
went through the actions of the late campaign.
He explained graphically the present position of
the enemy, and closed his speech by an appeal
to them to keep up their courage, to be ever true
to themselves and their traditions; true, too, to
those to whom they confided the command of
their forces; to hope on still, to quit themselves
like men; and he, for his part, promised them
a great and glorious ending to their struggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, and not till then, they broke out into a
burst of loud applause. Their ringing voices
could be heard in the most distant corner of the
Agora and in the high Akropolis, and all men knew
that he had spoken. They vowed vengeance
against the authors of his banishment, as though
it had been some others and not they who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>brought it about. In their joy at seeing him again
they dried their tears. With one voice they recalled
the sentence of death which had been passed upon
him, and restored to him all his wealth and
patrimonial estates, which they had confiscated.
They ordered the pillar on which the awful sentence
was inscribed to be demolished. They
made the Eumolpidai, the sacred Eleusinian priests,
revoke the sacerdotal curses which they had pronounced
upon him. They conferred on him the
office of Autokrator, or generalissimo of all the
forces, both by land and sea, which only on three
other, and most perilous, occasions in the whole
history of Athens was ever entrusted to anyone.
It made him absolute over the other generals,
and gave him complete and autocratic power in
all matters which concerned the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the Assembly of the Ekklesia was over
his friends made him go forth again, that all
might see him. He descended from the Pnyx,
passed through the western gate of the Agora,
where stood the great Hermes, guardian of the
market-place, and, hard by, a bronze chariot
drawn by four horses, where one stood life-like
in the chariot who had won the prize for Athens
more than three Olympiads ago. Ah, those four
dear horses, he had come back to gaze upon them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>as in the bronze they seemed to bound and leap
for joy of the encounter. He was there,—not
quite so full of life, perhaps, as he had been at
the time of the race,—but where were they?</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, passing the Eumenia portico and the
theatre of Dionysos, where his chorus had sung
before the whole of Athens in the Trachiniai of
Sophokles, his friends led him on by the Odeion
which Perikles built, with its peaked roof made of
the masts of captured Persian ships, resembling the
tent of Xerxes. He remembered being taken there
when he was six years old to hear the contest of
musicians when Perikles opened it. Then he proceeded
up the street of Tripods. Upon the temple
he had himself erected stood the tripod he had
gained when his chorus won the prize. Not far off,
a little higher up, on a smaller temple, was still
the tripod once proudly placed there by poor
Nikias. Then by the north side of the steep rock
of the Akropolis he passed the ancient Agraulian
sanctuary, where, as a young man, he put on his
first armour, and swore to defend his country
to the last. So past the Anakeion, the ancient
temple of the Dioskoroi, they brought him, by
Apollo’s grotto, to the Agora again, to the Stoa
Basileios, the Court of the King Archon, near
which was the Prytaneion, where the sacred fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>ever burnt, and where the Prytanes and other
privileged guests dined at the state’s expense.</p>

<p class='c010'>Their dinner was preparing, as he, followed by
the people who had brought him in triumph
round the rock of the Akropolis, came to the
Prytaneion. As a victor in the Olympic games
he was entitled to his share of the meal the state
provided daily for its public officers and honoured
guests. Never before had he taken advantage
of his privilege. He now claimed it. And the
people were astonished and delighted when they
saw the saviour of their country, their unconquered
general, of whose luxury and indulgence
so many famous tales were told, sitting amongst
the citizens, enjoying the homely fare as much
as any of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>His public duties finished, he was escorted to
his mother’s house by all who claimed relationship
with him, and they were many now. There,
in the quiet of that sacred place, we, like his
Athenian supporters, may leave him for awhile.
Nor shall we attempt to follow all his thoughts
when he left at nightfall the solitary parent who
had watched and waited for him while he had
fought his country’s enemies, and while he had
struggled with his great temptation to return too
soon to counsel and to rule his native land.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Afterwards on his way to his own house, so
long deserted, he was accosted by a well-known
voice that sounded older and much sadder than
when he heard it last.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Oh son of Kleinias, you have longed for
glory, and you have it. Does it seem as sweet
as you imagined?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed, Sokrates, I think it is sweet to gain
glory in fighting for one’s country.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And dost thou think thy country will render
glory to thee long?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Indeed, I hope so, if I continue to deserve it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Hast thou lived, then, all the years since I
first met thee on the banks of the Ilissos, and
yet hast not learnt the evil nature of this beast
called Demos?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I think I ought by this time to know something
of its nature, Sokrates.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then is it better, think you, to save a people
from its enemies, or to save it from itself and
teach it wisdom?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Why, I should say it is better to free it from
its enemies first, and teach it wisdom afterwards,
as I now hope to do.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Tell me, then, oh much-wandering, much-enduring
man, where in thy travels thou hast
learnt this wisdom, that I, too, may go to seek it.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>‘Alas! Sokrates, in all my wanderings I have
found mankind alike in need of it, alike in want
of it; and I would come to you, the wisest of the
Greeks, to learn it.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Then tell me, great strategos Autokrator,
when all thy possessions were taken from thee
by this demos, and thou hadst scarce wherewithal
to pay for thy black broth in Lakedaimon,
couldst thou bestow much money on thy
hosts?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No, by the gods! And I still sometimes
laugh to think how poor I was. How could I
give what I had not myself?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Which, then, is easier to obtain, money or
wisdom?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I should say it is easier to get money, for we
often see men who have acquired heaps of money
who do not seem able to get much wisdom.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And yet you hope to teach these people
wisdom, which you say you have not got, and
which is harder to obtain than riches.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Ah, Sokrates, it is still just as of old. Somehow
when I talk with you I seem to be ignorant of
everything; though when I am with others I
fancy I am cleverer than most of them.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And do you not know why?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Not I, unless it be that the oracle said truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>that Sokrates, the son of Sophroniskos, was the
wisest of the Greeks.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘And you know not why it said so?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘I have heard you say in the old days, but
now I quite forget.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Well, I will tell thee. Perhaps it meant that
I, in truth, was the most foolish of mankind.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘How mean you, Sokrates?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Because that all my life I have tried to show
the people their own ignorance, and they will turn
and rend me soon, for all my pains, as they will
rend you, ere many months are passed, for fighting
for them, oh beauteous son of Kleinias.’</p>

<p class='c010'>So they parted, and Alkibiades entered his
father’s house by the large heavy doorway, and
went into the courtyard, where the fountain
was splashing still as though he had never been
away, just as it splashed when he used to sit
and watch it in his dreamy boyhood, yearning
for knowledge, or in more ardent mood when
he looked upon it from his room at night,
longing for adventures and glory, and eager to
leave that quiet place where his mother lived;
as it splashed when he had gazed up at the
mysterious Akropolis, with the moonlight over it
making dark shadows on the walls of its silent
temples; as it splashed when he brought his young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>wife joyfully to her new home, and when he returned
there, on that guilty morning, and found
her gone; and as it splashed when he came back
from Ephesos and saw her lying still and silent on
her couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the day he had lived for, and fought
for, and schemed for; now it was here. He
had come home to Athens in greater triumph
than he had ever dreamed of Glory, that
he had followed after all his life, had come to
meet him, as she had seldom come to meet anyone,
and more splendidly than he, even in his
highest hopes, had been able to imagine. He had
got more than glory; he had got justice. As
he passed through the Agora, or market-place,
that day, he had seen men with hammers breaking
down and beating into dust, so that they might
take and scatter it into the sea, the record of the
false and cruel sentence which had been passed
upon him. He had broken down injustice. He
was going with his strong will, and with all his
might, to deserve more than ever his country’s
gratitude, so that when he died, fighting for her
some day perhaps, the abhorred sentence which
had been graven on the shattered stone might
be forgotten, and it might be writ of him upon
the eternal brass that he, more fully than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>other of her children, had loved, and lived for
Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>And yet, even at the ending of that day—a
day the like of which few men have ever known—even
at the end of that glorious day he heard the
words of Sokrates above the echo of the cheers
and cries of joy that were still ringing in his ears,
and he was somewhat sad.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> friends who had known the strategos in old
days thought that he would, for some time at least,
enjoy his hard-earned rest, and spend his time in
such pursuits as they knew he loved, and take his fill
of the intellectual and sensuous delights of Athens.</p>
<p class='c010'>On the day after the joyous one we have just
witnessed he began his work as sole absolute
general of the state. There was plenty of work to
do. Athenian citizens had grown disheartened, and
become lax in military discipline. He began by
making all those who could bear arms, from boys
of fifteen to men of sixty, meet every day for
warlike exercise. He instituted a series of alarms,
on hearing which, at any hour of the day or night,
everyone seized his arms, and ran to his appointed
post. Besides superintending these exercises himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and providing that the ordinary soldiers of
all classes were duly furnished with all things
necessary for their duties, he raised the knights, to
which order he belonged, to the highest point of
excellence, making them complete in their own
peculiar drill, and teaching them other exercises
which he had learnt in Thrace and Persia.</p>

<p class='c010'>He obtained one hundred new triremes from the
state, provided chiefly by the spoils and tribute that
he had brought with him from the Asiatic cities.
While half the day was taken up with the land
forces and the land defences, the other half he spent
on the water, attending to the drilling of the sailors
and the rowers at their work. No one was ever
more severe or strict in details, especially as regarded
the watchfulness that he required from the
sentinels, and if some of the lazier or more stubborn
of his soldiers did sometimes complain among
themselves, no general was ever more implicitly
obeyed. Not a murmur was heard openly against
his exacting, self-denying, necessary discipline
through all the three months spent in this laborious
business. The heart of the people seemed changed;
or, rather, the old heart which had beat so firmly
when Miltiades led them, was renewed within them.
Their pleasures were postponed. They recognised
that this was not a time to indulge themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>in their usual favourite amusements. Even the
comic playwright, who made fun of everything
and everyone on all occasions, grew almost serious
at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the end of three months Athens possessed a
compact array of troops such as it had never had
before. The huge fleet, with its complement of
sailors, perfectly equipped, lay in the port, ready
at the given signal to raise anchor and set sail.
But the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries
was near, and the general put off the departure of
his forces till after they, with all the other citizens,
had taken part in this great festival. Messengers,
for the first time for years, were sent through the
neighbouring states, to announce the approach of
the festival, so that all might attend who wished
to be present at, or take part in, the games
which followed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is impossible for us to realize the full importance
of these sacred rites. Founded originally on
the universal sense of helplessness in man, his
dependence on the mysterious powers of Nature
which, unmoved by him, yield him his sustenance
in life, and on his belief in a Divine sustaining
power when the strength of life is failing him—and
thus based upon his dependence on food in
life and on God in death, the Eleusinian mysteries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>grew out of the poetic mysticism of the earliest
religious reverence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The corn seed buried in the earth is represented
by Persephone, who, while gathering flowers in
a vale, ‘herself of gloomy Dis was gathered.’
Carried by him beneath the earth, she became
wife of the King of Hades, and queen of the
region of the dead. But Demeter, her mother, in
frantic grief, after wandering through the world,
came to Eleusis, and dwelt there, while the earth,
in sympathy with her, withheld its fruits. The
race of man was about to perish for want of food,
when Zeus, in pity of its helpless misery, allowed
Persephone to return to the earth and spend six
months of every year with her fond mother;—a
legend symbolic of the happy springing up of the
new corn and of the joyful harvest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, the religious instinct of man to pay
worship and devotion to the giver of his earthly
sustenance became mingled with the devotion, no
less natural to him, by which he sought to be
sustained and strengthened after death by the
powerful goddess of the regions of the dead. Much
of the religion of the Athenian Greeks centred
round this myth, and the later additions to it. The
greater mysteries, which only the initiated knew,
or could assist in celebrating, took the place with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>them of the religious exercises and devotions and
dogmas of a later age.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the first day the initiated gathered together
at Eleusis. On the second they made long symbolical
ablutions, as if to free themselves from
every taint of sin. On the third day they offered
sacrifices, as some small return to the divine
mother and her child, who gives to helpless men the
necessary fruits of earth, and a recognition of their
dependence upon her bounty. On the fourth and
fifth days other rites were celebrated, which were
not to be divulged; and on the sixth, the greatest
day of all, the citizens set out from Athens to
accompany the wondrous little statue of Iakchos,
a son of Demeter, in pompous march from Athens
to Eleusis.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was an addition to the earlier, simpler
mysteries, and had been imported from the East,
or perhaps from Krete. Iakchos was really the
infant Bakchos, representing the generative power
of nature, as well as the stimulating force of wine,
and was an introduction of a later time, when men
were not content with the purer celebration of the
innocent harvest of the corn-fields, with the bread
and honey of their fathers, but must have wine
from the grape-juice too.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the seven years that the Lakedaimonian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>garrison occupied the fort of Dekeleia, and ravaged
the lands of Attika, it had not been safe to go
beyond the city gates. Even the initiated dared
not approach the sacred spot by the customary
road. Some, indeed, had gone by sea, but for the
most part the maimed rites, for these years, were
but scantily attended. The sixth day’s solemn
procession, the great event of the whole festival,
had been abandoned altogether.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades determined to restore the festival to
its wonted grandeur. So the ‘spodophoroi,’ the
sacred heralds, were sent out to announce the
coming celebration, as of old, defying the Spartans
to interfere or stop them. When the time arrived,
he posted his hoplites all along the sacred way, and
through the mystic defile, and the valley of
Eleusis. Thus, the initiated could repair this year,
as of old, to the first five days’ performance of the
holy rites.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the sixth day, at the head of his cavalry, the
Strategos Autokrator marched from the foot of the
Akropolis through the Agora, and, passing on his
right the new temple of Theseus, took up his station
at the outer Keramik gate, at the entrance of the
sacred road, there to await the coming of the
priests and people. Presently the procession,
headed by the priests bearing the holy image, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>seen slowly wending its way towards them. Then
all along the sacred route, lined and defended by his
soldiers, the general, on his white Thrakian charger,
and in resplendent armour, led the way. The
people of all ranks, following the priests, made the
air resound with their ecstatic cries of ‘Iakchos!
Iakchos!’ The long road was flanked by tombs and
altars of the great departed, carrying men’s thoughts
back to the immemorial past, the heroic mythic
times; and here many of his renowned ancestors
lay, objects still of reverence and veneration.</p>

<p class='c010'>At three points on the road the river Kephisos
was crossed by bridges. At each of these the bearers
of the hierarchic image stopped to do the customary
rites. Thence they entered the mysterious defile
which, by degrees, opened into the pleasant valley
of Eleusis. The hills on either side echoed to the
constantly repeated cries, ‘Iakchos! Iakchos!’
till the Eleusinian plain spread out before them,
rich and lovely, bathed by the blue sea on the left,
the Eleusinian mountains skirting it upon the right;
and straight ahead of them, its white marble walls
glittering against the setting sun, shone the Akropolis
of Eleusis and the temples of the goddesses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Imposing as the procession was at all times from
its numbers and from the wild devotion of those
who formed it, it was trebly so on this occasion from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>the added spectacle of the strong, silent soldiers
who lined the way, and the splendid cavalcade of
knights who went before and followed in the rear
of it, and from the recollection of the seven past
melancholy years, when the multitude had kept
mournfully at home, fearing to go to offer their
observances to the great goddesses until the
saviour of the city had returned to make that
possible. It seemed as if he on this day was the
high-priest of Demeter, as well as their chief
general. The dreaded Spartan king, while he was
there, kept prudently behind his walls, nor dared,
for all his power, to show himself, or seek to
interrupt them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though they had started at mid-day, so much
time was taken up in the various observances along
the way that the September sun had sunk behind
the Akropolis long before they reached Eleusis. As
the night grew dark, torches were lit one by one.
The light handed on from one torch to another gave
a weird look to the great throng, until the whole
mass was lighted up; and thus, with wild waving
of the torches, amid a blaze of light, and with
cries and chants to Iakchos, ever growing louder
and more wild, they reached the holy temple.
So passed the festival beneath the ægis of Alkibiades;
and on the last day of the proceedings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>when the games were held, the gathering was
attended, as of old, by the famous athletes of
Greece, who came to strive for prizes and to
behold the invincible Athenian. He had a
twofold object in waiting for the festival. If the
Spartans had come out of Dekeleia, which was
not more than fifteen miles from the sacred way,
he would have found an opportunity of meeting
his old opponent Agis; if, as the event proved, the
Spartan feared to meet him, the power which
compelled such enemies to keep themselves shut
up within their fortress would be made manifest.</p>

<p class='c010'>His popularity with the mass of the Athenians
had reached what might have seemed its highest
point even before this; afterwards it became something
like idolatry. This free people forgot even
their love of liberty in their fanatic zeal to show
fresh proofs of their blind confidence in him.
Only religious fervour, warmed by the recent
worship of the goddess, and worked up by ceremonial
observances and strange, half-maddening
rites within the temple, can explain the step which
a large number of them were prepared to take.</p>

<p class='c010'>To gain a faint conception of what these religious
feelings were we must, as far as possible, put ourselves
in the place of the initiated, and of those who
were about to go through the process of initiation—almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the sole religious teaching of the age, the
guide which taught them how to obtain the blessings
of well-being here, and of an eternity of peace
and happiness in the Elysian regions after death.</p>

<p class='c010'>Added to this religious zeal, felt more especially
among the less cultured classes, there was the
patriotic gratitude of nearly all. Most of the more
educated had felt for some time that a change must
be made in the institutions of the state, if she was
to combat successfully against the oligarchic and
despotic enemies gathering around her, who had
not the disadvantage of the unstable and variable
policy incident to government by the voices of
the masses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Certain it is that, seizing the opportunity
offered by the present feeling of the population,
the numberless clubs which honeycombed Athenian
politics, and represented the majority of those
citizens who took the chief part in the affairs of
state, came forward, and urged Alkibiades to suppress
the constitution, to banish the demagogues
and the orators, who, they declared, had been the
constant cause of all their troubles, and suggested
that he who was already autocrat in war, master
of the forces by land and sea, both in and out of
Athens, and feared by the whole of Greece, should
accept from them a kingly crown.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>In</span> the course of this story we have had to watch
the hero of it assailed by many temptations. We
have seen him give way to some which many of
us think we should have overcome, and overcome
others to which most of us would certainly have
given way. This that stood before him now,
beckoning him, as it were, with wizard hand, was
the greatest of them all, and came in most specious
shape. All his life he had desired to excel. As
a boy, and as a young man, his greater gifts had
enabled him to excel and rule his compeers. The
desire for pre-eminence and command had not
grown less as, in his maturer years, he had found
that his proper place was at their head, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the others ceded that position to him as of right.
Yet in his most ambitious moods there had not
come to him the thought that he should ever rule
alone, supreme, in Athens.</p>
<p class='c010'>He had supposed that he might one day fill the
place of Perikles, but to a democratic Greek the
thought of usurping the sole power was almost an
impossibility. And yet the urgency with which
the offer came, the power and the numbers of
those who made it, assured him he had only to
consent, and he would be proclaimed ruler, not
merely without any dangerous protest, but with
the enthusiastic joy of nearly all the people. He
believed, too, and not without good grounds, that
this would be for the immediate good of Athens.
He saw the clouds that were gathering round the
state, the incapacity of the present form of
government to contend against the combined
power of Persia and Sparta. He knew that his own
strong personal influence with one important
satrap was unbounded, whenever he chose to
exercise it. He believed that he had made some
progress in the confidence and respect of another.
The embassy now on its way to Susa might bring
back to him, if he still held the reins of power, the
pledged alliance of the Persian king. He knew
that one strong arm, and one strong will, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>head of all, and wielding despotic power, alone
could grapple with the situation, and stave off the
threatening danger. His belief was justified by
the event. Here was a great temptation.</p>

<p class='c010'>He put aside the offer laughingly. He hesitated,
and communed with himself, but only
for one day.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Tell me, Agrestides,’ he said that night, ‘shall I
be king of Athens, like Theseus?’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘No,’ said Agrestides, ‘be a man, like Alkibiades.’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Agrestides, thrice hast thou saved me—first
from the Spartans, then from the Persians, now
from my greatest enemy, myself.’</p>

<p class='c010'>In the morning he gave orders that the fleet
must be ready to depart next day.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the head of a hundred triremes he set sail
at the dawn of a mid-September day. Shading
his eyes from the rising sun, he looked onward,
as if trying to wrest its secret from the future.
Then he turned towards Athens. He saw the
uplifted hands of thousands praying for blessings
on him as he went. He knew he might have been
their king, perhaps the founder of a kingly race,
and the saviour of the people from themselves.
But the splendour of his Athens, the largeness of
her arts and literature, her greatness, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>to live for ever in the wonder of the ages and the
races yet to come—these things had been grown and
nurtured, they had flourished, in her free soil; they
would be cramped and would perish under a fat
and lazy despotism. His hand should never be the
hand that killed them. He stamped his foot upon
the deck to check—his anger, disappointment?
No, only his emotion. He was never prouder of himself
than at that moment; he was proud of what he
had done for Athens; proud of what he was going
to strive to do for her; prouder, much prouder, of
what he had refused to do. Thousands were waving
hands to him, and bidding him gratefully adieu.
How many knew what he had renounced for them?
How many knew that they would never look upon
his face again? He saw the <i>Eros</i> lying in the
harbour, grown too old for the hard service on which
he is bound. He gazed at the citadel, and at the
helmed Athene. Did any sad foreboding cross his
mind that he should never more behold that much-loved
place? He passed by Aigina, where his
ancestor was once king—there might be kings in
those days—his royal body lying in its sanctuary,
surrounded by white marble walls. Strange the
thought that for a moment glanced across his mind,
that he might soon see that ancient king now a judge
in Hades, but might never see his land again.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>He made first for the isle of Andros, where the
inhabitants had revolted and received a Spartan
garrison. He dispersed the native troops and
the Spartan soldiers, who attempted to resist his
landing, chased them through the island, posted an
Athenian garrison at Gaurion, and left Konon, one
of his best officers, with twenty triremes to reduce
the capital; and then set sail for Samos, which
became again his base of operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost immediately after he left Athens a
signal tribute was paid to his military genius and
strength. Agis had been watching him from
Dekeleia, fuming at the insult of the procession
that dared to pass almost beneath his eyes to
Eleusis, and challenged him, as it were, to come out
and try to stop it. He had remained safely shut up
behind his walls as long as the conqueror was there.
No sooner was he gone than he made an attack
upon the city with 28,000 foot and 12,000 horse.
On a dark night he surprised the outposts near
the Keramik gate, massacred the guard, and had
it not been for the system of vigilance which had
lately been established, as far as we can see, the
city must have fallen to the Spartan. The alarm
was given. Torches beckoned from the Akropolis,
and were answered by torches on the other heights.
Athens was up in arms. Every citizen ran to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>post which had been assigned to him. And thus,
though Alkibiades was far away, it was his care
and watchfulness which saved the town.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the morning the people discovered Agis and
his Lakedaimonians lying close to the walls. The
cavalry rode right up to them, calling to the
Athenians to come out and fight them. The
Keramik gate suddenly opened, and as if still
instinct with the life that Alkibiades had breathed
into their souls, his horsemen charged the enemy,
and drove them off. Next day the Athenian
hoplites marched out, and took their stand before
the walls. Agis attacked them in vain, and,
covered by the archers and peltasts from the
walls, the hoplites did some execution on the
invading army. The Spartan Agis thought it
wiser for the present to return to his fortress at
Dekeleia.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time Alkibiades arrived at Samos events
had happened that utterly ruined the hopes and
plans which he had formed, and changed the
course of Grecian history. Two fresh characters
appeared upon the scene. The Spartans, when
their informal overtures for peace had been rejected,
set themselves vigorously to work to repair
the damage done them by the crushing defeat
at Kyzikos, and the subsequent loss of the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of Pharnabazos. They appointed Lysandros, the
ablest of their rising men, to the command of the
fleet, for they had need of an able commander at
this crisis, and they saw not the depth of his designs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lysandros, who was the son of a poor descendant
of an ancient family, and whose mother was a slave,
cherished an ambition to rise above the hereditary
kings of Sparta and all the other high-born Lakedaimonians,
who scorned him for his poverty and
his want of thorough breed. His one idea was
to gain his ends by success in war, untouched by
pity, and unmoved by any sense of honour, or by
any of the nobler feelings of humanity. The fox,
he said, can often gain his object where the lion
fails. Oaths, he once declared, were made to
deceive mankind. He had studied the career of
Alkibiades, and tried to learn the secret of his
success. Without the genius or generosity of the
latter, and a stranger to his higher qualities, he was
also without his weaknesses, or, if he had any of
them, he carefully concealed them, that he might
the better gain the ends to which he devoted all his
life, and to which he sacrificed everything worth
living for. While the one man renounced despotic
power that he might the better serve his country,
the other formed designs by which he might gain
such power, even at the cost of his country’s ruin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>The Fates ordained that at the time when Lysandros
came to take up his command, the instrument by
which he was endeavouring to work out his plan
was coming from far off to meet him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kyros, the younger son of Dareios, King of
Persia, a prince of high ambition, careless as to
the means by which he might obtain his objects,
and moved by an inveterate hatred of everything
Athenian, had been appointed by his father to
the supreme military command of Lydia, over the
head of Tissaphernes. On the way to take up his
command he met Mantitheos, and the other
Athenian legates, who were travelling with Pharnabazos
to his father’s court to negociate the
terms of peace. If they once got there they might,
with the help of Pharnabazos, who now inclined
towards Alkibiades and an Athenian alliance,
persuade the king to alter his policy, and to recall
the powers with which Kyros had been invested, and
so destroy the hopes and schemes which filled his
head. The prince ordered the ambassadors to be
given up to him. Pharnabazos protested in vain
that they were sacred envoys. Kyros cared nothing
for all that, and ordered them to be imprisoned,
so that they should neither proceed to Susa nor
return to Athens to report the failure of their
mission.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Kyros and Lysandros were necessary to one
another. The new Spartan admiral, feeling the
hopelessness of pursuing the war in the Hellespont
without the assistance of the representative of
Persia, turned his attention to the Ionian coast.
From Sparta and her allies he collected a fleet of
seventy ships, and sailed with them to Ephesos,
where Athenian influence was weakest, and where
he would be at the nearest point to Sardis, which
Kyros had made his capital. He soon appeared
at the young prince’s court. These two men
became close allies; they suited and resembled
one another. Lysandros laid before the Persian
the needs of his country, and persuaded him to
double the pay of the sailors of the Spartan fleet.
Kyros showed the wondering Lakedaimonian the
stores of gold he had brought with him for that
purpose. By this means the Spartan fleet was restored
to its old strength, and manned by the best
sailors, who were drawn to it by the larger pay
with which the admiral was now able to reward
them. This fleet was lying ready for action at
Ephesos, within a short distance of the port of
Samos, when Alkibiades arrived in the island.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new condition of affairs might well have
discouraged one of less resources. The ground
upon which he had been building crumbled beneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>him. The very largeness of his fleet became
a weakness to him; and his reputation, his
almost unparalleled success, a cause of discontent.
The object of his opponent in moving his station
to the Ionian coast was twofold. It hindered
the Athenians from getting their tribute and supplies
from their tributary towns; and it enabled him
to receive more readily the payment of the Persian
subsidy. Alkibiades had reckoned upon the influence
of Pharnabazos at any rate to stop any
further payment to the Spartans. Without that
payment he knew they would not long keep their
fleet at sea. He now found the subsidy not only
continued, but increased, while he could get
scarcely anything with which to pay his sailors
even the smaller wages he had promised them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead, then, of attacking the enemy at once,
he was obliged to lose time by employing his fleet
in petty freebooting expeditions on the Karian
coast. And when he had collected something in
this way, he could not get the crafty foe to meet
him in fair fight. In vain he brought out his
ships, paraded them before Lysandros at Ephesos,
and challenged him to come out and fight on equal
terms. The fox was too wary to be caught. He
knew that each day the enemy’s difficulties would
increase, while he could tempt that enemy’s best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>sailors from him by the bribe of higher pay with
Persian gold. Delay was what he wanted, not a
hazardous engagement with the first commander
in the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not being able to entice the Spartan fleet to
fight, Alkibiades determined to conquer, one by
one, the Ionian towns which were in revolt.
Leaving a portion of his fleet to blockade Lysandros
in the port of Ephesos, under the command
of a skilful sailor named Antiochos, who had been
pilot of the <i>Eros</i> in the celebrated race in pursuit of
Tissaphernes, with strict orders on no account to
risk an engagement while he was away, but to keep
the enemy shut up inside the harbour, he sailed for
Phokaia. Thrasyboulos was already there, and they
thought together to make a successful beginning of
the final reduction of these rebellious dependencies.</p>

<p class='c010'>Antiochos, whom he thus left behind, was an
excellent sailor, and his chief, who had known him
from boyhood, had no reason to suppose that he
would disobey his orders. Unfortunately, he was
one of those who mistake ambition for ability,
and thought himself brave when he was only foolhardy.
No sooner was his general-in-chief departed
than, finding himself in unexpected power,
he resolved to distinguish himself by fighting the
Spartans. With only two triremes, he entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the port of Ephesos, rowed past the bows of the
hostile fleet as it lay at anchor, and having by
words and acts insulted Sparta and the Spartans,
returned towards the rest of his ships, lying hard
by in the Bay of Notion, imagining that he had
done some valorous thing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lysandros, not believing that Alkibiades was
really gone away, and thinking that this attack was
but a ruse to draw him out, sent only a few swift
ships to overtake and punish the lieutenant. The
rest of the Athenian fleet came out to protect their
temporary leader, and sailed in disorder towards
Ephesos, not in close line, but one by one and
anyhow. Then Lysandros knew the master was
indeed gone, and hastened to take advantage of
his absence. He met the Athenians in line,
killed many of their men, amongst them the
rash and disobedient Antiochos, took fifteen of
their ships, and chased the others back to Samos.
This victory at Notion was of itself of no very
great importance to either side. But in its
result it proved the most serious and fatal blow
that had ever fallen upon Athens. To it we
can trace, with certainty, her overthrow, the overthrow
and final ruin of the most fascinating, and
in some respects the greatest, people who have
yet appeared upon the stage of the world’s theatre.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>As soon as Alkibiades heard of this misfortune,
he set out for Samos, but the old difficulty, the
want of money, made it necessary for him to tarry
on his way. He visited Kyme, not far from
Phokaia, to receive the tribute that was due.
The inhabitants refused to pay. He landed some
troops. The native soldiers came against him.
He was obliged to chastise them, and collect the
tribute they had failed to pay and some booty
by way of penalty. Then he returned to Samos.</p>

<p class='c010'>There he found his fleet with its prestige injured,
its numbers lessened, the friend to whom he had
entrusted it killed in the miserable engagement at
Notion, and all his men disheartened and murmuring.
He alone was not disheartened at this second
blow. He landed, learnt the whole truth of the
bad tidings, and embarked again, confident that, if
he could only get the enemy to fight, he would soon
wipe off the temporary disgrace which in his
absence had come upon his men. With the remainder
of the ships he sailed straightway to
Ephesos, and dared Lysandros to come out and
try which was the better fleet, the abler admiral.
Lysandros, notwithstanding the superiority of his
forces, thought it wiser not to meet the conqueror
of Kyzikos, and remained in port and in safety.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>We</span> must now return to Athens for awhile, and
with amazement behold the people there when
news of the affair of Notion reached them, and
see a piteous spectacle,—one of the most piteous
that is recorded in the pages of history,—an
exhibition of the inconstancy, the childish instability,
of this great people, for the sake of whom
their greatest citizen had refused a crown.</p>
<p class='c010'>Amid the shouting crowd that we lately saw
welcoming back the man who had rescued and protected
them, among the grateful mass who were
ready to throw themselves and their cherished freedom
at his feet, it must not be supposed he had no
enemies. Quiet they were obliged to be while he
was present, as the open enemies at Dekeleia had
been constrained to be; but they were there,
and the more the people shouted and adored, the
more their jealousy and anger burned.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>At the head of them was Theramenes. He
was one who had taken a foremost part among
the odious four hundred. He was the first to
desert them and turn against them when he saw
their end approaching. He was the subordinate
colleague of Alkibiades in the Hellespont. Under
him he had fought, and commanded a division of
the fleet with ability, and bravely attacked, and
helped to repulse, the Persians on shore at Kyzikos.
He returned with Alkibiades to Athens. But so
great was the enthusiasm of the people for the
greater hero that they had overlooked the smaller
one, and he had been allowed to land unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the oligarchic enemies of the absent
strategos there were other enemies of greater influence
among the people, the fanatic demagogues
and wily orators. These men either sincerely feared,
or professed to dread, the power of such a favourite.
They were not ignorant of the offer that had been
made to him. They had good cause to think that, if
he should accept the proffered dignity while he was
still the idol of Athens, not all their arguments,
nor all their eloquence, would be able to prevent
or modify the despotism which they feared. These
persons now made common cause with those of
their usual opponents who hated Alkibiades. Both
sets of foes together instilled their doubts into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>people’s ears. The secret work was made more
easy from the very power and reputation of the
object of their hate and dread. One who had
proved himself invincible and had beaten every
foe on previous occasions must, they said, if he
ever failed to win, have failed on purpose. If he
delayed too long before he fought, he did so, they
argued, from some hidden motive. Doubtless,
they said, he who at Abydos and Kyzikos, with
smaller numbers, had vanquished the combined
power of Persia and Sparta, could, if he wished,
with the larger fleet which they had given him, have
long ago humbled the smaller force of Spartans
alone and by themselves at Ephesos. The fact
that he had not attempted to do this showed that
he had some cause for letting the enemy escape.
And why did he leave the fleet in the face
of the Spartan admiral, and go off to Phokaia,
where he was not wanted? Why had he left the
main force of Athens, nearly all she had now to
depend upon for protection, in charge of an inexperienced,
unknown, ordinary pilot like Antiochos?
Why did he let him engage the enemy, and lose so
large a number of the ships which it had cost them so
much expense and labour to fit out, and so many of
their stalwart sons whom they could ill afford to
lose? Were not these things proofs, they asked, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>some ulterior motive, some secret dealing with the
enemy, or some sinister design upon Athens?</p>

<p class='c010'>To add to these covert suspicions artfully set
afloat, a deserter at this time came from Samos,—one
who had a private grudge against his general,—and
made absurd and lying charges against him,
which were listened to with eagerness by a crowd of
politicians, ever on the watch for some new thing.
And last of all came citizens from Kyme, complaining
that, without cause, Alkibiades had
attacked them while they were at peace with
Athens, had slain their soldiers, and carried off,
for his own profit, an enormous treasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seems scarcely credible that these unproved,
unfounded accusations could have been listened
to and believed by a people like the Athenians,
who had often shown clearness of vision in the
management of their own affairs. In answer to the
charge of delay it must have been pointed out that,
as they had not provided pay for their large armament,
the general was obliged to seek money where
he could, and, while seeking it, could not blockade
the enemy with all his force at Ephesos. The
second charge refuted the first. He went to
Phokaia, to begin with the subjugation of that important
city the reduction of the faithless Ionian
towns. He could not do more than leave as many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>ships as he could spare to keep up the blockade of
the enemy at Ephesos. He could not do more
than appoint one on whose obedience and discretion
he had good reason to suppose he could rely
to keep that fleet quietly on the watch while he
was absent, and it was not his fault that his orders
to that effect were not obeyed. And if a general
was to be judged in his absence, without an opportunity
of being heard, on the unsupported tale of a
private soldier in his army, who had some fancied
grievance, some dislike, occasioned by the necessary
discipline of war, it might be asked, what
general could long remain at his post or carry
out his duties? We hear only of these complaints,
nothing of the answers which must have
been made by the friends of Alkibiades.</p>

<p class='c010'>His enemies even dared to rake up the old stupid
stories about the mutilation of the images and the
profanation of the mysteries of Eleusis by him
who had a few months before done such great
service to both deities, and permitted the people to
renew their solemn observances in their honour. As
an instance of the kind of charges that were brought
against him, we may notice it was seriously said
that he was guilty of impiety in having dared to
return in pomp to Athens on the day that the
statues of Athene were being washed. Such were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the kind of accusations the enemy could find to
bring, such the charges to which the fickle people
listened. They decreed the deposition of the
warrior and statesman whom they had lately
made absolute strategos of their forces; they
elected ten others in his place, and ordered them
straightway to Samos to assume their functions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The new generals, with Konon at their head,
found Alkibiades in the midst of busy preparations,
determined, as soon as possible, and in spite
of every obstacle, to wipe off the slight disgrace
which, in his absence, the Athenian fleet had
suffered.</p>

<p class='c010'>On showing their credentials, he at once handed
over his command to Konon, and immediately left
Samos, and with him departed the fortune, the
glory, and the liberty of Athens, as though she
had become unworthy of these blessings. They
did not deign to visit her again.</p>

<p class='c010'>We who have followed the story of his life till
now, and have endeavoured, as far as may be
possible, after more than two thousand years have
passed away, to gain some insight into the working
of his soul; we who have seen him suffering
under similar injustice, and know how these wrongs,
and only these, could greatly stir his spirit, and
change for a time a loyal and kindly nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>into the fierce, relentless hatred of the wounded
lion, may well expect the threats of vengeance,
the cry of rage, the determination to undo the
wrong, and punish the authors of his injuries. But
whether it was that he was growing weary of
this constant strife, or that years had softened his
resentment and relaxed his care to battle longer
with his secret foes; whether he began to think that
the power and the glory which throughout his life
had been hitherto his aim was, after all, not worth
the fighting for; or whether his love for his country
had grown so deep that he would do nothing that
might injure it, we cannot tell. Certain it is he
went upon his way, and, during the time which
remained to him to live, showed no sign whatever
of anger or resentment.</p>

<p class='c010'>While he was in the Chersonesos two years before
he had marked the beauty and commanding
position of a high rock looking out over the Hellespont
towards Lampsakos, where the straits are
not much more than a mile across. Washed by the
waves of the sea in front, the hillsides form a
natural fortress on the north and west; the only
approach lay over the stream called Aigos Potamoi,
or Goat’s Rivers, which winds below the cliffs on
the south, and empties itself hard by into the
Hellespont. He saw what an impregnable stronghold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>might be erected there, and of what value it
would be to Athens against an enemy who might
attack the towns which he was rapidly receiving
back to their allegiance. With his own private
resources he planned and built a fortress on this
almost inaccessible spot, and to this lonely tower
he now retired with a few constant friends, some
of whom we have seen before clinging to him in
his exile. There, like Achilles, he stayed watching
the turns of fortune, waiting to see how soon his
countrymen, recovering from their blindness, would
repent of their ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>The word ‘ingratitude’ is hardly strong enough
to convey a complete idea of what their conduct
had been to him; for, from the moment when he had
gained the object of his fixed endeavour, and had
been recalled to Athens, his ardent desire was to
undo the injury he had done her in the past. He
would never admit that he had acted wrongly to
her in anything that he had done. If his vengeance
was terrible, it had been deserved. She
had brought her own chastisement upon herself.
When she repented of her sin, and made atonement,
his generosity had been aroused,—he pardoned
her. He determined to take off the penalty he
had inflicted on her, and which she was still paying.
As far as one can pronounce as to what would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>happened if this second crime had not been committed
against him, he would have been able, if
Athens had permitted it, to restore her to the
position which she held before the war.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had already begun his task. In spite of
the unforeseen difficulties which the junction of
Persian wealth with an unscrupulous Spartan’s
skill had brought forth, one by one the Ionian
towns would have fallen before him, as the towns
upon the Hellespont had done. Each one recovered
would have brought back a tribute-paying
subject city, and given Athens that of which she
stood in utmost need—the power to support her
navy. The Spartans were shut up at Ephesos,
and could be of no assistance to those whom she
had tempted to revolt. When the other towns
had been brought back to their duty to Athens,
he intended to bring all his force to bear on
Ephesos. Lysandros could not remain penned
up there for ever. He must either come out and
fight or surrender, and he had shown that he
was afraid to leave the harbour while Alkibiades
and the Athenian fleet were in those waters.
The Persian would, before long, grow tired of
paying for a fleet which was too timid or too
weak to fight. Even the treasure brought by
Kyros from his father must soon have been exhausted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>And Dareios would send no more gold
to be wasted on an ally who did nothing for it in
return.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lakedaimonians were growing tired of the
war. They had already attempted overtures for
peace. The difficulty the Athenians felt in accepting
the terms they proposed was that those terms
included the condition that the Ionian cities should
remain, as they then were for the most part, in the
power of Sparta. As soon as they were recovered
by Athens, the difficulty would have been removed;
and the only other term which Athens must have
insisted on had already been conceded by Sparta,—the
evacuation of Dekeleia by king Agis. All
would then have been in the same state as when
Alkibiades had gone to Sparta, and told the
Spartans what to do to humble Athens, and the
great war would have ended without much damage
done to either side.</p>

<p class='c010'>These things which might have been,—and
which he knew would have been, if he had been
left alone to do them,—these things, and man’s
ingratitude, he could now only muse upon in his
high fortress on the Hellespont.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>To</span> a man of active mind and determined courage
it ever seems an unworthy thing to give way for
long to sad musings and melancholy retrospections.
Wherever Alkibiades was he must be doing something.
If Athens would not let him do all he
wished to do for her, he would still do what he
could in spite of her.</p>
<p class='c010'>He had before made friends with many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Thrakian chiefs, who were always fighting among
themselves. He now organized and trained a
band of hardy savage warriors, some of whom
had served under him in his last campaign
against the Spartans; and before the spring
came, while the deep snow was still upon the
mountains, he was entreated by the Selymbrians
to come to help them against the Kaini,
who were menacing their territory. He felt
bound to the Selymbrians; they had given way
to him when he was in their midst, and had
acknowledged the supremacy of Athens. They
had, indeed, no particular claim upon him, but
they were Greeks. An enterprise of this sort had
some charms for him in his present humour; it
might bring booty and many things of which he
and his wild followers stood in need. He crossed
the Holy Mountain, where the cold was so intense
that the few Greeks in his band suffered severely and
envied the Thrakians with their long fur coats and
caps of foxes’ skins covering their heads and ears;
and he drove the Kaini back to their savage
mountain villages and away from the sea-coast,
and protected Selymbria and the other Greek towns
along the western shores of the Chersonesos.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thence he was called back to the south. The
Apsinthii, a tribe on the left bank of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Hebros, had crossed the river in their boats of
wicker-work and skins, and were threatening the
Odrysian king and the Grecian colonies in the
south. Passing through Apri, he came to Kypaela,
on the Hebros, in the territory of the Paeti, where
he thought he might find a ford across the river.
There was, however, no ford there, nor any bridge,
and he had no boats. So he went up the bank of
the river northward, and, crossing the Agrianes, a
tributary of the Hebros, he reached, by the
beginning of April, the main river again, nearly
opposite the village where Plotinopolis was afterwards
built. While he was engaged in searching
for a ford two Thrakian horsemen, in fine costume,
rode up, and made signs that they wished a parley
with him. Amongst his wild band there were but
few who knew much Greek, and the language of the
new comers was different to the Thrakian speech to
which he was accustomed; but he found at length
one who was able, not without some difficulty, to act
as an interpreter. The horsemen declared they
were sent by Amadokos, king of the Odrysai,
who was at his royal village on the other side of
the river, a little higher up; they said the king,
their master, desired to meet the Athenian general,
and begged to invite him to a state banquet that
day. They informed him that Amadokos claimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>to be of the same race as the Athenians, and would
make alliance with him, and give whatever pledges
he demanded. They offered to show Alkibiades
a ford higher up, where his horses might easily
cross, and where he would find the king’s royal
barge awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The offer was accepted, and Alkibiades promised
to meet the king at the ford that afternoon. One
of the messengers returned with the answer to his
master, the other stayed to act as guide. Great
preparations were made in the camp of Alkibiades.
The most presentable of his followers
were arrayed in all their savage splendour. Their
leader himself did not disdain to adorn himself in a
dress suitable for the kingly presence, and appeared
in his finest armour. Nor did he forget the gifts
it was the custom for a guest to bring when dining
with so great a personage.</p>

<p class='c010'>Early in the afternoon they reached the ford.
On the other side was the royal cavalcade, with
trumpets and drums; and there, amid barbaric
splendour, sat the king upon a white stallion with a
lion’s skin upon its back. Two Thrakians swam
the stream, guiding the horse of Alkibiades. The
royal barge, a sort of flat-bottomed punt, was
brought across for the leader, and when, not
without some dread of submersion, he had taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>his place in it, was pulled and pushed by naked
servants of the king across the stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades mounted his wet horse, and rode to
greet Amadokos. Loud blasts from the trumpets
sounded as they met. The king was serious and
polite, with a high-bred, stately courtesy, mingled
with an easy cordiality,—a natural politeness which
more civilized people have somewhat managed to
forget. He was evidently struck with the commanding
appearance of his guest. As the one
took the right hand of the other, something told
each of them that he could trust the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a king who boasted Athenian descent, or,
at least, Athenian relationship, the Odrysian’s
Greek was peculiar—certainly not Attik or Sophoklean.
There was a strange jumble of Thrakian
words mixed up with it; what few Greek verbs
were used by him were sometimes declined in a
way unheard before by the Athenian. Alkibiades
could, however, from what of the Thrakian speech
he knew, understand his host, as they rode off
together talking of many things.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the music at the meeting of the two distinguished
men was loud, it was nothing compared
with that which welcomed them as they were
assisted to dismount from their horses, and entered
the royal tent, where the banquet was awaiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>them. And a strange banquet it was. At the end
of the pavilion, on a raised platform, were set two
small three-legged tables, as the place of honour for
the king and his chief guest. All down the tent
on either side were other smaller tripod tables.
There were no couches to recline upon during the
feast, but seats in which each guest sat upright at
his table, in a manner altogether strange to one
accustomed to the Grecian banquets. On every
table were piles of baked meats of various kinds—venison,
kid, and mutton—and large flat loaves of
unleavened bread. When the blowing of trumpets
was over, Amadokos, sitting down, invited his
guest to be seated. Then, taking a large hunch
of bread, and the choicest bits of meat from his
table, he handed them to Alkibiades, who, seeing
the other Thrakians do the same to their neighbours,
handed some bread and the best pieces of
meat to the king. The Thrakians then set to
work vigorously, and ate their food voraciously,
the monarch sending to his more honourable guests
pieces from his own table so frequently that he
had nothing for himself, except what Alkibiades
presented to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as they began to eat, young slaves
brought in horns full of wine, and presented one to
each guest, beginning with the king and Alkibiades.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>After the king had eaten and drunk a little, he
rose, and, with a horn full of wine in his hand,
turned towards Alkibiades, who, having learnt
something of the customs of his entertainers, also
rose with his wine-horn in his hands. They both
drank of the fine strong Thrakian wine, but what
was left in the king’s horn he poured over the dress
of Alkibiades, who, though astonished at this
unusual attention, saw it was intended to do him
honour, and did the same to his host, pouring the
remains of his wine over the garments of Amadokos.
This mark of reciprocal goodwill so pleased the
Thrakians that they leapt to their feet, and deafened
the Greeks with their shouts of delight, but soon
sat down again to many other horns of wine,
which the slaves continued to supply unstintingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Agrestides now entered the tent followed by two
Greek servants bearing a splendid Persian carpet
which the Selymbrians had given to Alkibiades, and
a golden amphora from Chios, chased with figures
of Dionysos reclining and boys and girls gathering
in the vintage and pressing the grapes. Alkibiades
presented these gifts to the king, who received
them graciously, while the Thrakians jumped up
again, and shouted louder than before.</p>

<p class='c010'>Musicians then came in, playing on curious
shrill pipes and rude harps of seven strings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>making amongst them a most strange, pathetic,
wailing melody. To the cultured, musical ear
of the Athenian the noise of the drums and
trumpets of ox-hides had been painful. When a
boy, he had utterly refused to learn the flute or
flageolet, thinking it unmanly; but his love and
knowledge of music were shown when he presented
his liturgy at Athens, by the way in which his
chorus had been trained under his care, and by the
choric songs he had himself arranged. Now this
savage music, in the minor mode, of the pipes and
harps seemed sadly to recall something of old
times long past, and to inspire a tender yearning
as for something else unknown, indefinite, indefinable,
and brought back thoughts of his own days
that were gone by for ever, and sad memories of
his wife, and of the friends whom he had lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>These reflections were stopped by the sudden
entrance of a troop of buffoons, whose antics, coarse
and not too delicate, roused the loud laugh and
noisy acclamation of the revellers, who by this
time were getting not a little intoxicated with their
wine. Then came a pantomimic show and dance.
A warrior, laying aside his arms, represented a
poor despised field-labourer, imitating his ploughing
and his sowing, ever looking back while he
laboured, as if in fear. A band of robbers rushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>in, the peasant fought bravely for his plough and
oxen, but in the end, amidst the braying of the
ox-hide trumpets, he was bound and carried off
in triumph. All this was played in time to the
music of the pipes, and was meant to show the
superiority of the caste of robbers and soldiers to
the poor miserable tillers of the earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the feast was over, Amadokos and Alkibiades,
almost the only sober ones of the party,
retired to the royal private chamber. The king
told his guest that he had heard of his valour and
invincible arms, and of his having overcome both
Spartans and Persians combined at Kyzikos; and
informed him that he himself was descended from
Tereus, the ancient king of Thrace, who married
Prokne, daughter of Pandion, the old king of
Athens, and sister of Erechtheus, so that he, by
ancestry, was of the same race as his guest. But
now, he said, he was hard pressed by several of the
neighbouring tribes, who were constantly invading
his dominions and carrying off his people and their
cattle. He promised Alkibiades that, if he would
help him against some of these enemies, he would
pay his men whatever was customary, and any
booty they might take should belong absolutely
to the victor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades agreed to do whatever he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>against the Apsinthii, one of the most hostile and
dangerous tribes. He promised to return next day
and set off at once in pursuit of the dreaded enemy,
who were reported to be at this time not far off on
the western side of the river. Then, with many
expressions of goodwill from the king, he went
back to his camp, taking as many of his followers
with him as were in a fit state to cross the river—a
process which had a salutary effect upon some
of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next day Amadokos bade farewell to Alkibiades,
who, with a force of nearly five hundred fighting
men, two hundred of whom were mounted, again
crossed the Hebros, and set out in search of the
Apsinthii. After two days’ march he came up
with that wild tribe as they were returning towards
the river, encumbered with the flocks and herds
and other treasure they had taken. He routed
them without much difficulty, took their booty
from them and some hostages, and drove them
back across the Hebros. Some of the treasure
and all the hostages he sent to his new ally, king
Amadokos. When he was about to return to his
fastness in the Chersonesos, an embassy arrived
from the Greek colony of Abdera, further west, upon
the southern coast, praying him to come to the
help of that town against an unknown tribe from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>the north, supposed to be the dreaded Treballi.
Abdera was not an Athenian colony, but it had
submitted to Thrasyboulos two years before,
and Alkibiades could not refuse the summons.
With his strange followers, whose love of pillage
could be with difficulty restrained, he marched
westward through the hill country of the Bistones
and the Chorpilli. The marauding tribe from the
far north, more ferocious and stronger than any he
had yet encountered, were laying waste the territory
round Abdera, and threatening the town
itself and other Grecian cities along the coast.
They withdrew to the neighbouring hills as he
approached. It was only after a long and difficult
search that he discovered their stronghold, and
succeeded in coming to close quarters with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>He heard that they had made a fortified encampment
on the summit of a densely-wooded hill nearly
twenty miles to the north of Abdera, which they
made use of as a sort of rude basis for their freebooting
expeditions. Coming up to the foot of the
rising ground, under cover of a dark night, he
divided his cavalry into two divisions, posting one
on the level plain to the north, the other to the
south of the barbarians’ camp. His heavy-armed
foot he placed in ambush on the western side where
the wood was thickest.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>Before daylight, while the savage horde were
sleeping off the effects of the last night’s carouse,
he, with his light-armed peltasts, or sharp-shooters,
stole up the hill on its steepest side, towards the
east, and, reaching the rough palisades which the
rude warriors had thrown round their camp,
suddenly broke in upon them. The barbarians,
roused from their sleep by this unexpected assault,
finding their fort broken at a point where, from the
steepness of the hill, they thought themselves
secure, and exaggerating in their fear the number of
their assailants, who raised the most fearful shouts
and yells as they rushed in, retreated from their
high camp, after a faint resistance, and rushed,
wherever they could find a way of escape, pell-mell
down the hill. Those, the majority, who took the
north side, as well as those who in their hurry chose
the south, were despatched by the horsemen
waiting for them on the plain below. Others, as
the day broke, seeing the slaughter of their friends,
made for the wood on the west, and were either
taken prisoners or slain by the heavy-armed foot,
who were there in ambush expecting them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades found a camp deserted by all except
the women, who were chiefly those whom they had
carried off from the villages round about; though
the chiefs had brought a few with them from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>own country. He gave the camp up to pillage,
and, gathering the women together, he and Agrestides
stood guard over them. His rude soldiers
could not understand this. Satiated with the
plunder they found, they hoped for a further reward.
It was only by the voice and sword of the leader
and his faithful friend that the otherwise defenceless
prisoners were protected. The women who were
natives of the country he sent to their homes with
gifts; the women of the chiefs of the invading
ruffians he kept as hostages. The prisoners taken
were found to be men of gigantic size, and so
hardy that no fatigue seemed to affect them. He
confessed they would have been indeed formidable
foes if they had been well armed and disciplined.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus he rescued Abdera from her terrible enemy.
He also gave the people of that town some wise
advice as to preparations for defending themselves,
if others of that ferocious tribe, as was not
improbable, should come at some future time upon
them when he was not there to help them. This
advice the citizens of Abdera remembered when it
was too late. A few years afterwards the Treballi
poured down again from their mountains in the
north, and destroyed the effeminate inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c010'>In return for what he had done for them, the
citizens provided him with pay for his followers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>and ships to transport them to the Chersonesos.
He arrived at his fortress at the end of the summer,
with the spoils of his barbaric enemies and considerable
gifts and treasure, the marks of the gratitude
of Grecian cities. He now paid off his men, and
sent most of them as valuable auxiliaries to his
friend Amadokos, who was still at war with
his northern enemies, bargaining only that they
should return to him whenever he might need
their services.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amadokos entreated him to come himself to
lead his forces, but Alkibiades had other objects
in view, and higher hopes than perpetual tribal
warfare amongst the Thrakians. The king received
this important assistance with expressions
of eternal gratitude, and promised to come to fight
with him against the enemies of Athens, if at any
time the Athenians, his relations, might require his
aid.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'>The loss of Alkibiades was soon felt at Athens.
Konon, in the spring of 406, through mismanagement,
lost thirty ships in an action against the
Lakedaimonians near Lesbos. He retreated into
the port of Mytilene with the rest of his fleet, and
there found himself caught in a trap by the Spartans,
and completely shut up both by land and
sea. Two ships alone escaped to carry the news
of the disaster and perilous position of the general
and his fleet to Athens. The Assembly decreed
that a new fleet must by all practicable means be
raised and sent to rescue the blockaded general at
Mytilene. Every old hulk was furbished up,
every craft that could possibly be made use of
was pressed into the service of the state. In a
month one hundred ships were ready, manned by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>old and young. The lowest classes, as well as the
highest, were enlisted. Knights, and even slaves,
were made to go on that final and most fatal
expedition. The cloud of fate hung over it, the
great gods hated it from the beginning.</p>
<p class='c010'>Facing Lesbos, and close to it, are three small
islands, then called the Arginousai. Thither in
July the new fleet came. Kallikratidas, who commanded
the Lakedaimonians, leaving fifty ships
to keep up the blockade of Konon and his armament
at Mytilene, foolishly engaged the new
Athenian fleet with inferior numbers. During the
action the Spartan admiral was drowned. The
Spartans fled, the Athenians followed them, and
took or destroyed more than sixty of their vessels.
But all was of no avail. That last victory was the
final blow by which the overthrow of the Athenian
state was consummated; the prowess of its sons
was as the lurid ray of an angry setting sun before
a night of utter gloom.</p>

<p class='c010'>The generals were charged with having, in the
ardour of the pursuit, neglected their sacred duty
to the wounded and drowning sailors, whose
hands, the accusers said, were in vain uplifted to
them, praying to be rescued from the waves. The
people of Athens had been brought, through their
misfortunes and their exhausting struggle, to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>condition of delirious tension. Their feelings were
strung to such a pitch that they could be worked
upon with ease by designing enemies. The oligarchic
faction took advantage of the opportunity. To
them, anything which might weaken the existing
order of things was a gain, even if it involved the
slavery of Athens. The victory at Arginousai was
unwelcome news to these men. The alleged inhuman
and impious conduct of the generals after
the fight was eagerly laid hold of by them. It
gave them the means of nullifying the effect of the
success, and of getting rid of the only able officers
left to Athens. With these intriguing politicians
were now, for this same purpose, combined the
demagogues, who were not displeased at finding
an excuse for attacking men in the high position
of the generals.</p>

<p class='c010'>The people heard with dismay and indignation
a highly-coloured tale of dying and dead seamen
and soldiers abandoned to their fate. On the same
day, and at the same sitting of the Ekklesia, they
thanked the generals for the victory they had gained,
and dismissed them from their offices at this time
of peril, ordering them to return at once to Athens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two of them fled, one died, the rest came back.
Then, worked upon by many an artifice, by which
the designing and unscrupulous knew how to mislead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the people, the Assembly, without proper trial,
and without even jurisdiction to try the cause,
sentenced them to death. As far as we can judge
from the evidence on either side, it seems that the
accused men had done everything in their power,
consistent with their duty to the state, to save
the shipwrecked and the dying. Theramenes,
who, if anyone, was guilty of neglect of this duty,
which had been specially imposed on him—Theramenes,
the evil genius of the time, who always
comes upon the scene when there is anything
particularly evil to be done, became, to save
himself, the principal accuser. All of those in
whose breasts the old Athenian love of justice and
fair trial burned felt the degrading iniquity of
the proceedings and the sentence. But, so low
had Athens fallen from her old estate, they dared
not raise their voices in protest against the deed,
lest perchance they might be involved in the like
fate. There was one left who cared not for the
consequence of doing right, for the peril of refusing
to take part in the wrong. Sokrates alone,
as if prophetic of his own doom too soon to come,
denounced the violation of the law.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six of the generals, including Thrasyllos, to
whom the people owed so much, and the son
of Perikles and Aspasia, were poisoned. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>the transient success at Arginousai robbed the
Athenians of those who might still have done
something towards saving them.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have seen how at this time Alkibiades was
helping his fellow-countrymen in Thrace. Nor was
Lysandros idle. With the assistance of his friend
Kyros, in a year’s time he was able to raise the
Spartan fleet to more than its wonted strength.
In September, 405, he appeared at the head of one
hundred and twenty triremes before Lampsakos,
which was still held by an Athenian garrison. He
was soon followed by Konon and five other generals
with one hundred and eighty ships, the last fleet
which Athens had sent out having been increased
by the vessels of the enemy she had captured off
the Arginousan islands the year before. But they
came too late for the relief of Lampsakos. It had
already fallen. So they crossed the Hellespont,
and anchored at the mouth of the Aigos Potamoi.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is difficult to understand how anyone with
any knowledge of naval tactics could have chosen
to anchor in that unsheltered place, with an
enemy so near at hand. Ships of war at that
time were constructed to carry men rather than
provisions, so that, except on short cruises, the
crews were obliged to land day by day to obtain
their daily food. There was no town near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>station the generals had chosen where they could
procure anything. They had to leave their ships
and go some way inland, or along the coast, to
buy such things as they were constantly in need
of.</p>

<p class='c010'>From his fortress Alkibiades saw the arrival of
the Lakedaimonians, followed later by the Athenians.
He watched the siege of Lampsakos,
which he had taken from the enemy; he saw it
fall again into the hands of that same enemy.
He saw his countrymen approach the base of his
high rock, and take up a position where, if they
should be attacked, they must inevitably be
destroyed. To him, with his quick perception, and
with the experienced eye of a strategist, it appeared
a token of mere madness in the commanders to
have selected such a spot. His first impulse was
to leave them there to take the consequence of
their stupidity. But there were serving under
them many whom he had himself commanded in
past years, who had fought bravely under him,
and with whom he had shared dangers, men whom
he loved and had often led to victory. He was
acquainted with the skill and cunning of Lysandros,
and the cat-like cruelty of his nature. He saw
him preparing for a final blow. He could stand
by no longer, nor restrain his compassion for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>country and his old comrades-in-arms, whose lives
were every moment in such jeopardy, and who,
if he did not interfere, must soon be slaughtered
through the incapacity of those who led them.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a great effort, which cost him very much,
for it laid his proud soul open to rebuff, he mounted
his Thrakian mare, and, tearing down the narrow
road which led from his tower to the plain, as fast
as she could carry him, lest his pride might make
him change his resolution, he rode through the
camp, and up to the tent of the six generals. He
showed them the various objections to the station
they had selected—how Lysandros must destroy
them if he came upon them in that perilous position,
as assuredly an admiral of his experience
would endeavour to do. He offered to lead them
himself against the enemy. They would not listen
to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he prayed them by all that they held dear—the
great interests of Athens concentrated on
that final armament—at least to seek shelter in
the neighbouring port of Sestos. ‘There,’ he
said, ‘you will find secure anchorage, and markets
where your crews can obtain all they want near
at hand, and you can await the enemy’s attack
in safety, or, when you see your opportunity, strike
a blow at them.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>‘We are in command now, not you,’ was the reply
of one of them. They bade him go about his business,
nor dare to approach the Athenian lines again.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went back slowly through the camp, an
outcast, treated as an enemy. Some of his old
friends and comrades recognised him, and sorrowfully
followed him as far as they might go. Stopping
to look back as he ascended his rugged hill,
he saw the vast collection of war vessels lying
quietly at anchor in ignorant security. He could
see many an old friend among them. He knew some
of them by name. Amongst them he discovered
his old ship, his own <i>Eros</i>, patched up to do battle
for the state once more. How many reminiscences
came over him! He thought of the gladsome
voyage he had once taken on her to Ephesos, in the
heyday of his youth and splendour, when the god of
love was emblazoned on her purple sails, and of the
sorrowful tidings which met him as he came back
home again, and made him pause and meditate a
little upon life in the midst of its enjoyments.
How many another expedition in her had turned
out sorrowfully! He recalled how, decked with
the red roses of a hot July, she had borne him off
to Sicily, amid the cheering of the fickle people;
how she had been taken away from him at Thurii,
and how he had found his old companion again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>at Samos. How many pleasant places they had
journeyed to together, and how many fights and
triumphs they had shared! How well and steadfastly
that good old ship had served him, always
true and constant; and there it lay, a thing grown
old! Would to the gods men were as true as
masts and timber! Then he rode sadly up the
steep hill, and reached his solitary fortress.</p>

<p class='c010'>At least he had done what in him lay to save
his country. And, as Athens had dealt with him
before, so her degenerate servants had dealt with
him that day, treating him with contumely and
insult. It seemed worse to them that he should
gain the meed of glory by their acting on his
counsel than that the state should come to ruin
by their rejecting it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five days afterwards, on the last day of September,
at noon, the Athenian fleet lay unsuspectingly
in the same position. The crews had gone to Sestos
to buy food; the soldiers were dispersed foraging
about the country. From his watch-tower Alkibiades
beheld a single Lakedaimonian vessel leave
the harbour of Lampsakos and cross the straits,
followed at some distance by another ship. Then
on a shield raised high upon her mast he saw the
sunlight glisten. A similar flash was passed on,
reflected in like way, by the second ship to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>in port. He comprehended all its meaning. A sign
had been sent that the Athenian fleet was left unguarded.
He saw the Spartan ships come out
silently and swiftly, and he saw Lysandros pounce
upon his prey. Some of the deserted ships had one
man on board, some two, some none at all. He
saw the Spartans leap into them, cut their hawsers
and their rigging, and move them away without
resistance. Konon raised an alarm, and escaped
with nine triremes. The sacred state ship, the
<i>Paralos</i>, which was under better discipline and
better guarded than the others, also escaped.
That was all that was left out of a fleet of
near two hundred vessels.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Spartan hoplites, in their red tunics, landed
in the bay, took possession of the camp, and as
the Athenian soldiers, hearing the trumpet-call,
returned, they were taken, one by one, as in a
trap. The Lakedaimonians lost not a single man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus an army of over three thousand soldiers
fell into the hands of a remorseless enemy. The
whole of those three thousand fighting men, taken
as prisoners of war, were, by the orders of Lysandros,
murdered deliberately in cold blood. From
the scene of carnage we would fain turn away our
eyes, as did the Athenian in his lofty tower, his
heart bursting with helpless rage.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>So</span> ended the great Athenian war. It had been
a duel between the two great states, not a war
of the Peloponnesos. The Peloponnesos, with the
exception of Laconia and one or two allies, had
little to do with it. The Argives had been for
Athens rather than against her,—or, at least, they
had been for Alkibiades, except for a short time at
Miletos, when he beat them, and they soon resumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>their allegiance to him. This is a strange instance
of individual character attracting, not another
person or party merely, but a whole state.</p>
<p class='c010'>With the ending of the war we could wish to
end this tale, but it must follow its hero for a
little space. With the war ended the Athenian
Republic. The people were not what they had
been. Their light had flared up too brightly, and
was going out. Aischylos had gone some time
before; Euripides, despairing of his country, had
abandoned it, and died a year before the closing
scene; Sophokles died in this year of calamities.
Only the comic genius survived for a time, to
laugh at the follies of the dying grandeur. The
greater artists of Athens were gone, her statesmen
were departed. When the <i>Paralos</i> brought
the news of the loss at Aigos Potamoi, the groans
of those who first heard of it at the Peiræus
were echoed by the guards all up the road which
led to Athens, along which we lately saw a procession
pass in triumph. Byzantion soon fell.
Lesbos, Chalkedon, Sestos submitted. The rest
of the dependencies of Athens turned away from
her. All the Athenians whom Lysandros found
in any of them he ordered back to Athens, with
what object we shall soon behold. Having
quickly undone the long and painful work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>Alkibiades, he arrived by the end of October
with his fleet before the port of Athens, and
blockaded it. Agis and Pausanias, the kings of
Sparta, with their allies, besieged it by land.
Boiotians, Megarians, all her old enemies, were
let loose upon her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Month after month the siege went on. All
supplies of food by land and water were cut off.
The people from the numerous towns connected
with Athens had been driven into the city, to add
to the number of the starving. The citizens, with
all this added host, were reduced to the last pinch
before they would show any sign of yielding.
At length they consented to send deputies; but
the conditions proposed on either side were such
that neither party would consider them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The famine came on with steady steps. The
people said they would die of hunger rather than
accept humiliating terms. The Assembly passed
a law, with heavy penalties, that none should
speak of peace. This was at the closing of that
fatal year.</p>

<p class='c010'>The famine was drawing closer. Hitherto it
had been only the poor who had been caught by
it, but now the rich suffered also. Theramenes
was the first to break the new-made law. He
was allowed to approach Lysandros—not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>mention peace, of course, only to endeavour to
find out what it was the Spartans wanted. He
stayed away two months.</p>

<p class='c010'>The famine was now king of Athens, dealing
death out right and left on all classes, quite promiscuously,
making little distinction between rich
and poor, caring, it seemed, nothing at all for
democrats or oligarchs. When Theramenes at
length came back, he brought small consolation.
He could not, for the life of him, make out what
it was the Spartans wanted. He was sent back
to make peace on any terms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, at length, he found out what it was she
and her allies did really want. He found them in
session deliberating on the doom of Athens. A
Theban deputy, speaking for the Boiotians, demanded
that the Athenians should be slaughtered
man by man, or sold as slaves; that the walls
of Athens and all her splendid temples and public
buildings should be destroyed, and that grass should
be sown where she had stood. The Korinthians
concurred in this demand. The pride of Athens
in her days of glory made them forget what she
had done for them in times of trouble. Sparta
alone remembered it, and she could recollect it
because it served her purpose to remember it.
She declared that a city which had once deserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>so well of Greece must not be utterly destroyed.
She wanted to reduce it to dependency upon
herself, not to crush it. She wished to make a
subject-city of Athens, with a Spartan garrison
and a military governor ruling as her Viceroy.
The other states did not want that. It would
have made Lakedaimon as strong, and perhaps
much more offensive than Athens had ever
been.</p>

<p class='c010'>So they agreed upon a compromise, and settled
the terms upon which peace might be given her.
The fortifications of the Peiræus must be dismantled,
the arsenals destroyed, the long walls,
which she had built and cherished as her great
security, must be pulled down. She must renounce
all her possessions, own nothing out of
Attika, give up her fleet, except such few ships
as Lysandros might permit her to retain, and
make alliance with Lakedaimon.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Theramenes brought these terrible, heart-rending
terms and read them out before the
Assembly in the Pnyx, first an awful silence fell
upon the multitude, then sobs were heard, then
someone rose on tottering legs to utter a weak
protest. A few others tried to speak against
them, muttering that a people such as they were
should hold out still, and should die within the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>walls, rather than yield on such terms. But
hunger had done its work. Theramenes was sent
once more to Lysandros to tell him that the gates
of Athens stood open to his forces.</p>

<p class='c010'>On an April day in 404, at the head of the allied
armies, Lysandros made his entry into Athens.
The last insults were inflicted on the miserable,
vanquished citizens. Rude Spartan soldiers,
dancing clumsily to the music which their women
played upon their pipes, looked on and jested
while free-born Athenians were made to toil with
pick and spade at the destruction, stone by stone,
of the strong defending walls.</p>

<p class='c010'>The proud people had not yet reached the end
of all their punishment and degradation. There
was a secret clause in the terms of the capitulation
which Theramenes had not thought it necessary
to mention publicly, but which had been agreed
upon between him and Lysandros,—one to which
Theramenes, at least, did not object. As soon
as the Spartans had made themselves masters of
the city and the Akropolis, a meeting of the
people was held, as usual, in the Pnyx, as though
they were still a self-governing democracy. An
agent of Theramenes, following the private convention
made with the conqueror, contended
before the Ekklesia that the people had shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>itself unapt to manage the great affairs of state,
and that its inconstancy had brought them to
their present lamentable plight; and he suggested
that it would be better, for the present, to make
over the direction of its affairs to a chosen body
of thirty of the wisest citizens.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Athenians had lost their walls, their dependencies,
their fleet,—all that could make them
great and glorious; but they had not yet lost
the semblance of their freedom: they had their
Assembly. They declared they would never part
with that. Who could tell but that some day fortune
might return again, and bring back something
of what they had thrown away? As long as they
had their constitution, they might at least imagine
that they were free; and when the dark time passed
away, they would still have the Ekklesia in which
to make their own laws and choose their own
rulers, as in the past. They remembered the
condition of the city when the four hundred were
in power. It might be even worse if the whole
government were in the hands of but thirty untried,
possibly ambitious, men,—friends of such
well-known and distrusted oligarchs as Theramenes.
They rejected the proposal with indignation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lysandros was watching them. His sanguinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>will was law in what had been free and stately
Athens. He solemnly counselled the people to
accept the proposed new constitution. He let them
know that his counsel, if it was not accepted, would
become something more urgent. A fresh session of
the Ekklesia was called; the late decision was reversed.
The people, under compulsion, voted
themselves and their power away. Theramenes
and twenty-nine other persons named by him were
elected and had authority given them to reform
the constitution.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reforms made by the Thirty consisted chiefly
in the murder of those who ventured to differ from
them. They excelled the Four Hundred in their
crimes. When Lysandros went off with his fleet for a
short time to carry on the siege of Samos the people
threatened to rise against their tyrants. Kritias,
who now took the most active part amongst
the thirty—Theramenes being too timid—sent in
haste to the Spartan admiral for help against
his outraged countrymen. Spartan soldiers were
sent to prop up the usurpers and to disarm the
people. Kritias was kept in power for a time by
Spartan hoplites quartered in the Akropolis, who
menaced the unarmed citizens from the sacred
Parthenon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The reign of terror that ensued, when lists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>were opened on which all friends of the governing
Thirty might write the name of him whom, for
any reason, they might wish put out of the way,
has had its counterpart once or twice since in
the history of the world. The details are always
much the same. Those who perished were the most
worthy, the men who had done most for the state,
and deserved most from it, or else those whose
wealth made their death a thing to be desired by
those who would share the plundering of it. The
number of the slain in a short time exceeded
fifteen hundred. The estates and all the belongings
of the victims were taken by those who were
their accusers, judges, and executioners.</p>

<p class='c010'>As is usual in such cases, the tyrants before
long began to be suspicious of each other. Theramenes
was the first to go. He got frightened.
He ventured to point out to his colleagues that
their excesses might, in the end, shorten their
reign. That was enough. His conduct when a
member of the old Four Hundred was not forgotten.
Kritias accused him of treachery. He charged him,
amongst other things, with having deserted the
drowning men at the battle of Arginousai, and of
having falsely thrown the odium of that desertion
on the other generals, and of thus causing them
to be unjustly sentenced. Theramenes made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>spirited defence. Kritias, taking credit to himself
for extraordinary patriotism and self-abnegation
in sacrificing to his country this great friend
of his, cut him short, called in the eleven Prison
Commissioners, and ordered him off to death. He
was dragged from the altar where he sought refuge,
and carried through the town protesting against
his fate, which few thought undeserved.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Kritias was the Kritias we know so well in
the Platonic dialogues. There seems to have been
a strange medley in his nature, and it is an
instance of the fidelity of the portraits drawn in
those dialogues that, when Sokrates, himself an
ardent oligarch by conviction all his life, raised
his voice against the iniquities of the thirty
oligarchs, Kritias spared his master’s life.</p>

</div>
<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> people soon repented of their conduct to
Alkibiades. Not long after they drove him away,
when Konon was beaten near Mytilene, we begin
to hear the murmur growing more distinct—‘Had
he been there, this would not have happened.’
Some at first believed the old fables
that were told about him. Some thought he
would try to make himself despotic. But these
suspicions gradually died away. The desire for his
wise counsel, and his strong generalship, growing as
disaster followed on disaster, came to its fulness
during the terrible siege. And as death and
famine stalked about among the people, and
their dear ones died in cruel agony before their
eyes, while they awaited their own turn in consuming,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>gnawing hunger, and it at last was plain
to those who were still left alive what must be the
conditions by which alone death could be avoided,
we can still, in imagination, hear the cry of impotent
remorse sounding loud amongst all the other
vain regrets of men throughout the ages—sorrow,
contrition, repentance, anger with those who had
misled them, and regret come too late.</p>
<p class='c010'>Then in the reign of terror, in the year of
anarchy, as the greatest fell, not now by famine
nobly suffered, but by the sword and poison of
their countrymen, who, encouraged by an enemy
encamped within the citadel and holy places, in
Athens trampled on Athenians, all within the city,
except the Thirty and their creatures and the
enemy, were ever casting longing, but forlorn and
hopeless, eyes towards that fortress on the Hellespont
where they believed their former saviour
dwelt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Thirty were not ignorant of this desire
among their indignant subjects. They trembled at
the thought of what Alkibiades even yet might do.
Neither were the Spartans certain of the fruits of
their victory while their old opponent was alive.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the first acts of the thirty tyrants after
coming into power was to decree his banishment.
They proceeded to confiscate all his estates in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>Attika. They had some cause for their apprehension.
In the early winter, during the siege of
Athens, unable to hold himself aloof from what was
going on, and knowing that he would be the next
object of the hatred of the Spartans, Alkibiades had
left his stronghold in Thrace, crossed over into
Phrygia, and sought out Pharnabazos at Daskylion.
They had exchanged oaths of mutual
friendship and hospitality. Alkibiades believed
that he could trust the Persian satrap, and, indeed,
he was in want of faithful supporters at that
time. His soul was set in tumult at the thought
of his native city being about to fall into the
hands of Spartans and Boiotians. He could not
rest while it was in his power to help her. The
satrap had been a noble foe; it might be that he
would become a generous friend. At least, he was
not a partisan of Sparta or of the young Kyros.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades was courteously received at Daskylion
by Pharnabazos, who had long admired him
for his prowess and extraordinary skill in war.
In a short time the peculiar attraction which had
drawn all the hearts which he had ever tried to
win was felt by his new friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as he had been before the intimate associate
of Tissaphernes, so now he soon became the constant
companion and counsellor of the satrap of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>Propontis. To compensate him somewhat for the
loss of his patrimonial estates in Attika, Pharnabazos,
with Eastern magnificence, gave him the
annual revenue of Grunion, a town in Mysia, on
which he might have lived in ease and Asiatic
luxury, as Themistokles had done before him. To
most people, indeed, to everybody else, the state of
Athens looked as if it was beyond all cure. Nothing
could well appear more utterly forlorn than her
then condition; nothing more hopeless than the
prospect of recovering her freedom.</p>

<p class='c010'>While he was at the court of Pharnabazos he
heard of the death of king Dareios Nothos, and the
succession of his eldest son Artaxerxes. He knew
the character and ambition of Kyros, the late king’s
younger son, and suspected that he was plotting
deeply with Lysandros against his brother. He
found that Kyros was collecting an army from
among the Greeks of the Ionian towns, enlisting
especially the Spartans. This could not be without
some hidden object; and no doubt the object was
to levy war against, and attempt to overthrow,
the king, his elder brother. To Alkibiades this
opened a fresh opportunity. There was no salvation
for his country to be found in Greece.
The thought came suddenly upon him one night,
when he was pondering on these things, to seek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>help from the Persian king. Lysandros and the
Spartans were bound to stand by their ally, the
crafty Kyros, to whom they owed so much, and from
whom they might require more. With Persian
gold he might recruit an army of experienced
Athenian hoplites and Argive peltasts, meet at
last on equal terms the cunning Spartan leader,
avenge the slaughter of three thousand fellow-countrymen
slain at Aigos Potamoi, and punish
the destroyer of his country’s liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then why not set out at once and at all hazards
for the Persian capital, see the new king himself,
be the first to disclose to him the danger that
was threatening him from his own family,
show him the number and the strength of the
army of the Grecian colonists that was being drawn
together by Kyros, offer to lead against them the
royal forces and the picked Greek band which
with Persian aid might easily be raised, and
rid the king of this unworthy and treacherous
brother? His fame had penetrated into Asia;
his name was well known at Susa and Babylon,
the Persian capitals. What might he not become
at the court of the Great King—he who had
never lost a battle, or failed to gain the love
and admiration of anyone whose affection he
was anxious to obtain? Then, having roused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>up the wrath of Artaxerxes against the Lakedaimonian
allies of the unnatural Kyros, and
gained his confidence and gratitude, what might
he not accomplish at the head of a well-trained
army?</p>

<p class='c010'>Already he could fancy himself, victorious over
Lysandros, Spartans, and Boiotians, over all his
country’s enemies, entering once more triumphant
into Athens, to end his days in peace and happiness,
dealing out just laws to his emancipated
countrymen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such was his dream. By degrees he unfolded
his hopes and fears to Pharnabazos, and persuaded
him to give his help in this great and
difficult adventure. The satrap, too, could see
visions rising up before him of even greater splendour
than that which he had so long enjoyed. To
be associated with one like this Grecian warrior
in saving the king, his master, from treachery and
treason must surely be rewarded by the highest
honours that the king could possibly bestow.
There was a possibility of even greater things, if
anything unforeseen should happen to the king,
and Kyros should be discomfited by this invincible
Greek general; while if the contemplated mission
failed, Kyros and his Spartan allies need never
know the part that he had taken in it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>With a sufficiency, then, of Persian gold, and
the safe-conduct of the satrap, Alkibiades set
out late in the autumn, accompanied by Timandra
and by the faithful Agrestides. The route to
Babylon, the capital, where the king generally
lived, was long and mountainous. At least three
months, they expected, would be taken on the
way.</p>

<p class='c010'>They started from Daskylion with many expressions
of eternal friendship on the part of their
host, and making first for Azani and Synnada, they
passed along the base of the range of Olympos,
the northern boundary of Phrygia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pharnabazos had insisted on their taking an
escort with them—at least, on the first part of the
way; for he had to admit that the mountainous
portions of his viceregal dominions were infested
with robber tribes. The escort was almost as fierce,
and to some of the party as terrible, as the robbers
they came to scare away; and, when the open plain
was reached by the banks of the Rhyndakos, the
country looked so peaceable that Alkibiades sent
the escort back with a large reward and a warm
message of thanks to his generous friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>The small party were not sorry to be relieved
of their noisy and warlike protectors, who were
too fond of displaying their extraordinary horsemanship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>and their deftness with their swords to the
detriment of one another. In the still autumn
weather everything on that fertile plain breathed
of calm and peace, as though the hard work of the
year was finished. So they journeyed on quietly,
and with as little fuss as possible, for Alkibiades
was anxious, as they got further south, and approached
the territories of Kyros, to avoid the larger
towns and the notice of the inhabitants. He had
no wish for another sojourn in the castle of Sardis.</p>

<p class='c010'>They reached Azani a week after they left
Daskylion. Timandra would fain have rested
there a little, being somewhat tired by the journey,
but the leader said they must push on to a more
secluded place and rest themselves there, before
they set out upon the long and unknown road to
Babylon. They started again almost immediately
for Synnada, the next town of any importance
which they must make for. Three days’ good
travelling, with the lofty Dindymon upon their
left, brought them at last to Synnada.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been thus far on the road from the Ionian
coast before, and when staying at Magnesia with
Tissaphernes, he had become the owner of a little
villa, or Persian country house, near the village
of Melissa, some five miles from the marble
quarries of Synnada. For, some time previously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>when tired of the life he was leading at the
satrap’s court, and not knowing how long it
might be before he was recalled to Athens, he
had explored some distance into the interior
of the land which we call Asia Minor, and
coming suddenly upon this villa, he was struck
with the beauty of the woods and hills around it,
and had fixed upon the small country place as a spot
to which he might retire with a friend, if need be,
far from the bustle of the world, and where he
might end his days in peace. Like many other
energetic and ambitious men, he longed at times
to be rid of his constant anxieties, and to enjoy a
period of rest. The house he had chosen stood
some way from the high-road which leads from
Synnada to Metropolis. He had enlarged and
improved his small domain, and had there been
honoured by the presence of Tissaphernes, who
came to visit him on one occasion when he, too,
was tired of excess of luxury, and wanted to
exchange the pleasures of his court for the undisturbed
companionship of his bosom friend.
At the end of that visit the satrap presented the
small domain to his friend, made him come back
with him to Magnesia, and Alkibiades, having
been called away soon afterwards to Samos, had
not seen since then his rural, calm retreat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>The travellers reached this place at the end of
September. Timandra was enraptured with the
charms of the lovely spot, and was for making
Alkibiades stay there altogether and give up his
great enterprise, letting kings and republics go
their way, and resting there in peace for ever,
without troubling himself more about the rights
and wrongs of struggling men and women.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was much indeed to make him loath to
leave the pleasant scene, for it was very beautiful,
and the journey before him was full of dangers
and fatigues in unknown lands. He would first
have to get as best he could to Ikonion by Mount
Paroreios, more than a hundred miles away.
Thence he would be obliged to journey south to
cross the great Tauros chain by the high and
dangerous pass to Tarsos on the sea-coast; then,
after skirting the Mediterranean, to strike across
Syria and North Arabia to the wide Euphrates;
and then, perhaps, if the king was not at Babylon,
to cross that river and the Tigris, and proceed
to Susa.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this was an unknown world to him. He and
Agrestides must go alone,—perhaps never to return,
and he might possibly end his life in a Persian
dungeon, or leave his body on some mountain
pass. However, he must not give way to foolish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>fears; he had gone through greater perils many
times before, and a vista of fresh adventures,
larger successes, opened up before him, ending
ever with the attainment of the one fixed object
of his thoughts and his desire—the liberation and
the final triumph of his country.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Three</span> months before the departure of Alkibiades
from the court of Pharnabazos, Kritias had sent
secret messages to Lysandros warning him of the
growing feeling of regret among the Athenian
people for the loss of their late strategos. He
reminded the Spartan admiral that it was the
part of a wise man never to despise the aspirations
even of the abject—for Kritias still prided
himself on his philosophy—and hinted that as
long as the dreaded opponent of both of them
was alive, the foolish people would continue to
aspire. And who could tell, he added, what such
a one as that might do?</p>
<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>Even Lysandros, the assassin of three thousand
valiant soldiers, prisoners of war, shrank from
the suggestion when he understood the full meaning
of the missive of the philosophic Kritias.
Even he would rather not, if he could help it,
stain his hands deeper, and in the blood of such
a one as Alkibiades. Lysandros was himself, on
his father’s side, sprung of heroic ancestry. He
too was of the Herakleidai. He might massacre
three thousand common soldiers, but he hesitated,
and almost refused, to take a part in an act such as
that which was suggested to him. He sent back
an ambiguous answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Kritias wrote straight to the Ephors at
Sparta. The influence of one whose power they
knew so well was as much dreaded by them as by
any of the Thirty; while to King Agis, the thought
of revenge on his old enemy, his hated rival, was
indeed sweet. The Ephors sent a peremptory order
to Lysandros to compass, by all means, and speedily,
the death or capture of the object of their fears.
Lysandros dared not dally any longer with their
command. He knew that Alkibiades was living
at the court of Pharnabazos. He heard of the
influence he was exercising over the satrap, an
abler man than Tissaphernes, and of the splendid
provision that the satrap had already made for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>He was in some doubt as to how Pharnabazos
would act, but he sent a copy of the Ephors’
order to Daskylion, with a strong request to take
immediate steps to carry out the Ephors’ wishes,
adding a warning that any disregard of this request
would be held to be conduct hostile to Sparta,
as well as to Prince Kyros.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pharnabazos thus found himself in a pitiable
plight. He was not without a sense of honour—of
Eastern honour. That sense of honour had
lately been greatly outraged when the Athenian
ambassadors to the late king were forcibly taken
from him by the young Prince, and imprisoned
against the honourable understanding of all
civilized nations. He had endeavoured to make
up for this, as far as he could, by his cordial
reception of Alkibiades, the late Athenian strategos,
at whose suggestion the embassy to Persia
had been sent. Besides this, there was the oath
of mutual friendship and hospitality between
them. His former opponent was now his guest;
as such his life was inviolable. He could not
defile that sacred relationship with blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moreover, he had conceived a more than common
attachment for the Grecian warrior, who had
sought his aid and friendship when driven off
and hunted down by men of his own race. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>old spell had been cast over him. He had always
admired the man; to that admiration was added
now a feeling of affection. Besides all this, the
mission on which, with his concurrence, his guest
was gone might very possibly succeed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He determined that, come what might, he would
not harm him. And yet the mandate was very
plain; there was no mistaking it: he must either
comply with it or forfeit the friendship, and incur
the enmity, of the all-conquering Spartans. If
Kyros was successful in his intrigues, and the
threatened revolt should break upon them, what
would become of his power, and of what value
would his life be then? He hesitated. Then he
bethought him of a compromise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alkibiades had been gone some days, the escort
had returned, when the sanguinary mandate of
the Ephors came to Pharnabazos. He argued
with himself that if he merely suggested the
wishes of the Spartan government to someone
else, and left the rest to chance, he would not be
responsible for the result, whatever it might be.
And even if others, in consequence of the
whispered suggestion, sought to do an act of
violence, perhaps they might not overtake the
brave Athenian; or if they did,—well, he bore a
charmed life, so all men said, and might escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>or overcome assailants. In any case he, Pharnabazos,
would not be implicated in the deed. He
would save himself, and perhaps his honour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Pharnabazos had two relatives, a brother and
an uncle, who lived near him at Daskylion. To
them, in strictest confidence, he told his trouble,
and the dilemma in which he found himself. He
would not have even a suspicion cast upon his
fame, and could not allow any injury to be done to
his friend and former guest, but, he said, the burden
that was laid upon him overwhelmed him; he asked
them their advice how he could get rid of it. He
confided to them how he wished that something,
almost anything, would happen to take it from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Without another word, the two relatives set
out upon the track of the travellers, taking some
retainers with them.</p>

<p class='c010'>By rapid marches they arrived at Synnada, a
few miles from Melissa, where we left Alkibiades
resting with his friends, after their long and
tiring journey, seeking to gain fresh strength
before they started on the more hazardous and
less known way which lay between them and
the Persian capital. Agrestides had noticed that
his master, for the first time since he had known
him, began to show signs of weariness while they
were on the road, and, soon after they had reached
Melissa, he told them of a foolish dream which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>troubled him the night before, the meaning of which
he could not understand. In his dream he fancied
that a woman was supporting his head and looking
sorrowfully at him, while she combed his hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next night, sadly, as if from some presentiment
that could not be overcome, he went early
to rest. Timandra and Agrestides, having attended
to his wants, retired to their own rooms,
at a little distance from his, which was in the
front part of the solitary house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Like sleuth-hounds the sneaking emissaries
stole on; they reached the village at nightfall.
They heard their victim was living there almost
alone. There were six of the pursuers altogether,
yet they feared to strike the blow. One of them,
more daring than the rest of the band of cowards,
undertook to do it. He crept stealthily into the
room, snatched with shaking hand the sword that
lay by the couch side, saw the hero lying restlessly
in sleep, and, seized by a sudden panic at the sight,
slunk tremblingly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>A hurried conference was held. None of them
would venture to approach him, though they had
possession of his sword. ‘Let us set fire to the
house,’ someone proposed. ‘If he is not burnt
alive, we can slay him as he escapes.’</p>

<p class='c010'>This was agreed on. The cowardly assailants
collected a quantity of fallen leaves and dry wood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>and, piling these combustibles noiselessly before
the house, set fire to them, and retired some distance
into the darkness. The noise of the crackling
fire awoke Agrestides, who shouted to his
master to escape, and was attempting to put out
the kindling fire, when he was stricken through
the heart by a Persian arrow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cry of Agrestides awoke his lord. Half
choked by the smoke from burning leaves and
wood, he rose, and sought his sword in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then at one bound he cleared the smoke and
flames. Unclothed, he stood before the assassins
like a deity in wrath. At the sight of the dead
body of his faithful follower he uttered a cry as
of a god in pain. His figure stood out against
the flames behind him. He rushed upon an
unseen enemy. The murderers fled at sight of
him, but one of them, hiding behind a stunted
bush, aimed a dart which struck him fatally.</p>

<p class='c010'>He fell. The place where he was lying faded
from his view. He was a boy again wandering by
the Ilissos. He heard the festal music, as, crowned
with violets, he led a joyous crew along the streets
of Athens. He fancied he was bringing home his
bride, as he had done on the happy marriage day.
He was standing in the tribune on the Pnyx, ten
thousand faces turned to him, with voices hushed.
He saw his swift steeds at Olympia bear his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>chariot on to victory. He saw the <i>Eros</i> garlanded
with roses moving slowly to the stroke of
oars as the crowd called out their farewell to
him from the shore. He was fighting once more
at Kyzikos; Spartans and Persians fled before
him. He heard the loud pæans of his victorious
soldiers. He stood again upon the deck of the
Eros as she entered the Peiræus; the people
thronged about him shouting their welcome in his
ears, and strewed their flowers at his feet. He saw
his mother and his son—then all grew dark.</p>

<p class='c010'>And there he lay, far, far from home, his
proud thoughts, his high hopes, his great ambition,
like his friends, all gone! Gone, too, was his anger.
The furrows which in the last two years had
begun to mark his brow were gone. The old exceeding
loveliness, the air of high-bred dignity
remained, and was as splendidly conspicuous as
ever. A smile of peace and triumph was upon his
face, as though, beyond these shadows, he had
already met old Aiakos, his ancestor, and was
rejoiced to behold him. There he lay, watched
over by Timandra.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
